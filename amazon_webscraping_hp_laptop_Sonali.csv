Reviews
"According to HP it is a laptop but it falls under family of Notebook. From dimensions it should be classified as Notebook. Light weight, no DVD player and non replaceable Li-on battery. Good 2.3 GHz processor with 4 GB RAM works well. Windows 10 home opening and closing time normal. HP updates all drivers comfortably and window update works well. Box has only notebook and power chord. We have to get all other including warranty through HP website.I have loaded office pro and everything looks smooth. Display is good in some angles. Sound is ok. Very good key board and track pad. Worth buying for the price we pay.

"
"I would request customers who have brought items on EMI through SBI card pleasr check your statement details as I had brought this prouduct on EMI of 9666/- including interest but bank is charging additional interest on this. 9666 + 330. Actually if they had to charge then they should have charged either 9666 per month or 9444+interest for three month. I would request Amazon also to look into the matter so that customers can freely use SBI cards for EMI payment.

"I'm reviewing this laptop after 4 month of use.Pros:- Overall looks seems interesting.- Screen size and display is awesome.- 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI, 1 RJ45 connector,  USB 3.5 JACK, SD card slot, CD Rom.- With Intel i3 7th gen this laptop works  fine with all applications and  browsing experience is too good.Cons:- You need to wait a minute after starting this laptop to be able to work. Else, it starts to hang.- Full size keyboard. The numeric buttons on the right should not be present.Overall verdict:Decent laptop at this price.
"
"Let me start with my message stating Very unsatisfactory product. It is i3 7th gen with 4gb Ram but it is slower than a celeron processor my other laptop. Infact cant be compared as simple basic task like sending mail cant work in this laptop forget the gaming etc. VERY VERY SLOW . 100% memory and 100 % DISK usage show all the time in if u open task manager.I mailed HP looking at the messages from HP from other reviews. It seemed to be quite promising that someone from HP customer care will take the laptop solve it or replace it sad thing no one even bothered to reply to my mail.So sick HP service.
"
"I have purchase this laptop  and use from last 20 days. Performance wise it is very slow .bulky and not comfortable for everyday use.Suggestions : You will get better laptop in the same price.
"
"I bought this laptop a day ago.It is mentioned in amazon that this laptop has lifetime validity for ms office.But actually it is not.We need renew it every year.Feeling very very disappointed with Amazon for mentioning a wrong feature.
"
"Bloody product doesn't power on at all... When called customer support they reply so adamantly...
"
"display quality and speed both are very bad.
"
"Kindly update about products it's original by HP?Find the photos and confirm the same.I am using currently i5 and i3 but this one looking different
"
"Pros1) sound quality is good2) picture quality is satisfactory3) camera is average, OK in this price range4) keypad is comfortable5) life time validity for windows 10 home and MSO student.Cons1) anti virus macafee is trial version for 30 days2) opening of applications are slow, better to go for i5.3) battery is not easily removable.NoteValue for money laptop. But compromised in performance.
"
"On first Boot it took around 2.30 hrs  after that never booted always hanged during booting totally waste of money and tension of not returning  this trashPro: Advice goto showroom first try lappy dn buy because for online marketing. They are just selling crap
"
"First of all the performance was nothing to write home about.I spent more time downloading and installing updates than actually using the laptop.It was dead slow too. It altogether stoppedworking after 7 months. I contacted HP customer care and they advised software recovery.I tried the steps advised by them still it is not booting.The product is still under warranty and it was used only for online classes and basic browsing IE, no gaming or other heavy stuff.I requested a service visit but they declined saying that for software issues service visit can not be arranged.I don't know what is the use of Guarantee and buying a licensed Windows version .As I am living at a remote place with no nearby service centre,I am left with no option other than dumping the item with this kind of support from HP.Should serve as as eye opener for any one planning to go for an HP laptop.After almost one month the laptop is still not repaired.Should serve as an indicator of the much pom-pom Ed HP service.My advise is please desist from buying this crapUpdate:Now HP says the defect is on hard disk. The service engineer replaced the hard disk. However the USB media I bought from HP shelling out Rs. 1100 is not working. Finally the service engineer installed windows by cloud recovery. (however HP has promised a free replacement of the recovery media). Subsequently the keypad started functioning erratically. The lappy is still at the service centre. I don't know  what to make of the whole process
"
"Good product.Awesome battery backupWorth for moneySimple drawback is that it doesn't have antiglare display
"
"Hello Folks,The product review shared by other always help me, buy a product so It is my responsibility to write the review.This laptop I bought 2 weeks ago. Till now my observations are:Pros:Light in weight.Single coat so appearance is nice.Keyboard is robustSound quality is good.Cons:If you want speed this is not a product to buy.Charging speed is not great.Touch pad is not that smooth.Laptop soon become very hot.Overall if you do not want to play games & budget is less than 30 k. You can give this product a thought.Thanks for reading Hope it will be helpful.
"
"Nice sound quality ,nice backup of 4.5 hrs ,value for money
"
"Please go with another brand,for mine system is crashed within 6 hours of delivery of laptop.
"
"Worse purchase I ever had in Amazon. I won't complain anything about Amazon, but here hp is providing low quality product. The laptop's display got damaged within 1 month without any physical damage. When I asked for the warranty they rejected it saying it's not manufacturing defect.it's actually a manufacturing defect due to to low quality parts and hp is blaming customer for such occurance.Don't ever trust in hp products..
"
"would recommend dell laptop over HP after buying this (i have used dell and they are far better than HP)only two major advantages of this laptopms officegreat speakerthe display is low quality, system is slowi have dell also with an older configuration and it performs a lot better
"
"Value for money
"
"This laptop is dead slow. I am using an MSI laptop 2013 model which is far better than this. Actual laptop cannot be this much slow, I am sure this is not original. Please don't buy through online. I am into ecommerce side but  I would say never but through online. I replaced the one I received first but replaced one also not bad. I feel I will break this, I have to wait to open a new tab also.. Sad.
"
"Awesome looking laptop....i don't know why this much negative reviews.
"
"When system is turned on it takes much time say 20 mins to turn on, provided that I have installed minimal softwares. And restart of system requires more than 1 hr stating that all the updates are running in the background.Sql server will be the only heavy weight software installed, and more than 250gb of hard disk is free. Win 10 preinstalled, i3 7th gen processor. Does anyone face the same issue.
"
"Value for money is good but sounds quality is normal and battery life is only three hours. In a nutshell this laptop is good in its price range. Thank you.
"
"First of all the product packing was just great..Second , the laptop is gud.Pros-Anti glare display is just great.Keyboard is gud .Camera is avg.Multitasking is just great.Sound is loud and clear.Laptop is lightweight.Cons-Lags a bit sometimes.Maybe an upgrade of SSD drive will improve performance.For gamers RAM nd Graphics needs to be upgraded.Good for medium gaming.Overall a great laptop in this budget of 31k.
"
"In a single word- it's worth. Initially you may feel that is slow but after updates it will work smoothly.
"
"I am really very very disappointed with the performance of this laptop. From the first day till now it never worked normally......lots of hanging issue. For every task it will take minimum of double time and after that also it will be working slowly. Even if I am typing something it will appear after few seconds. I m really tired up of using this laptop and regret of buying this. Look wise it's awesome battery life also average but one and only major problem with this laptop is it get stucked after any command given it includes from starting the laptop to opening your files to typing anything......I don't know why I bought this laptop ...... seriously not expected from Amazon to deliver the product like this....I sometimes feels that it's even original or not ??
"
"Worst product from HP. Performance is too slow. Applications hangs frequently. I got defective one in which speaker head phone was not working. Warranty was also not showing as one year.
"
"I have brought this product almost 1 month back and also submit the complaint on his slow performance. Also I have taken remote support from hp help desk service center but no improvement. Hence they sending there home assistance who is still not turn over and making arrangements as per my availability.Currently seeking hp revert. Or needs to return back such faulty product.
"
"I received this product on 9th May 2019, as I've not installed any app but it is too slow. Whatever I open it takes too much time to open. Better to go with Dell or Lenovo. Not satified with this kind of product from HP.
"
"Super quick delivery as always from Amazon.Have been using this laptop everyday for about 8hrs with not a single issue faced till date.Not sure about its performance for gaming as I have never used it for gaming.Battery life is also pretty good. 4-5hrs with the power saver mode on and mildly heavy usage.Easy to carry around as does not weigh too much and its very compact as well.Overall performance is good with reasonably heavy usage but I have not tested with heavy usage, programming and gaming.My opinion: PRETTY REASONABLE, GOOD PERFORMANCE, LIGHT WEIGHT, VALUE FOR MONEY.
"
"Good laptop with a very beautiful colour and design.. WINDOWS 10 needs upgrade .. after completing of all updation it runs fast..I am very satisfied with this laptop..
"
"Overall laptop is goodA colour that is not common.(standard)Display is superb depend upon the quality you see.Mcafee antivirus for 30 day trial.Performance - goodDisplay- excellentStorage- plenty and enoughGood for programming.
"
"In first place Laptop got delayed while delivering it to me. We called amazon told upfront that we don’t need and when we are trying to return the same without opening the packaging amazon not taking the amazon back. It is just selling the High price products to customers just with images and text and these is no way to return it back if you don’t need or don’t like it or performance is not at your expectations.Poor amazon policy , if you buy this you need to buy with your own risk and it will be final sale and there is no way to return and live with it.When we are trying to down load or upload or trying to install our first software it is Super slow.When we are trying to view YouTube videos and Dragged the video here and there to see the performance and laptop is kind of stuck and responding after 1 or 2 mins. Even when you make video in full screen mode it will take a while to pop up.What not there several performance issues with this laptop Never ever buy this and Don’t Don’t Don’t Don’t Buy this.When we are extracting 500Mb file from zip , Memory reads and memory utilization going up to 100% and you can’t use any application and Dam super SlowUpdated comments on 27-jul-2019 : we have requested for technician visit and tech guy confirmed that there is a issue finally amazon provided replacement and replacement is more worst you can see The pics which I have updated in the review.

"Review after using 15days...Too slowwwww, worst product by HP, no response by customer care of Amazon.Go with dell or lenovo or any other brand but not with HP or Amazon service.Laptop on krk so jao 😴😴😴😴Can get better laptop in same price.
"
"After using it for 2 weeks i am writing my review.It is very nice and very useful product. It is for daily use. Battery life is good. It get charged very fast. Screen quality is awsome. I think that camera quality should little bit improve otherwise everything is okey
"
"I love this product. Packing quality is also so good.
"
"Avoid buying this laptop. It looks like someone has put a duplicate processor and RAM inside it. It is painfully slow. I am considering to throw it away and buy a better laptop from Market.
"

"Gadget Guys.. Here's a short review of the above model Lappy that I bought today.Design - Very GoodWeight - Surprisingly very light from HPSpecs - Nice config in such a decent budgetFHD Screen - a New addition and quite good resolution especially with Anti-GlareBattery - the most interesting aspect of this Lappy, charged it twice as used heavily to test it. Gives a pretty good backup of 4hrs. Very much satisfiedi3 and 4GB DDR4 combo is performing more than I expected. Initial booting and updates are gonna make feel that the Lappy is slow, but give it time to setup, later Lappy just flies.Overall a pretty good Lappy at an affordable price 😊👍And all this coming in a package of 26.5k in offer after applying Credit Card offers
"
"I just bought, this product from Amazon not too much satisfied from product in range of 31k. Speaker quality is very poor, screen quality is not up to the mark, Not good from my side.But thankful to Bajaj finserv to fulfill our financial need.. 😀 Thnx Bajaj and Amazon
"
"You get what you pay for. The modest pricing is reflective of the responsiveness of the system. However, it does the job as an entry level laptop for basic browsing, reading or as a secondary laptop for use by children.Biggest pros are the screen size and the extended keyboard with a dedicated number pad.Biggest cons would be the slowness of the laptop and the absence of a backlit keyboard (though the latter was known before purchase).
"
"Just..... Kaam chalauHaving heating issue while charging.So much hanging problem... In just normal daily use
"
"I am totally disappointed with this product. I thought HP will done the job but it's do slow. Not only that, it often hanging. Is it HP or any local product? How a branded product can be so?
"
"It's a decent product in this price range, it could have been lighter though.  With windows 10 preloaded it's definitely value for money. One of the buttons was getting stuck, but amazon after sending a technician and verifying has immediately replaced it with a new laptop.
"
"Don't hesitate to buy this product if you are a student because it is the best entry level laptop which serve every important functions for every student so please don't hesitate buy itIt also has a pre installed MS officeWindows 10Value for money
"
"As per specifications of laptop, I have to receive lifetime warranty of ms office, but I have got warranty of 1 week and even I have raised a query which is still not replied.
"
"Good laptop for my home use. MS Office was pre-loaded and set up was smooth. A bit slower at starting than my expectation for Core i3 7th Gen, but otherwise good value at this pricepoint.
"
"System come with windows 10 and office suite, but the booting speed is very slow , if you are planning to upgrade system to SSD we can get a better performance wich is 5 * Faster.
"
"1-Before arrived My Order HP Laptop  i got a message someone will come for Installation but nobody came2- I have read before buy clearly mentioned will be replacement within 10 day's if i don't with performance3-  I really don't like voice quality and picture quality and I called up for replacement another productbut i got to know through cus care it can be replace same one if any default but can't replace with other product which no where mentionedReally Really disappointed as regular customer since many year""s
"
"Only screen border is black rest of all parts in silver...u cant work in dark area coz there is no light in keybords keys
"
"In this range I guess this is a good laptop. There was a single drive no partition so that one can change. Installing everything in C drive slows down your lappy.Secondly, I had an issue with a black screen error every time I log in into that. But after that it was successfully replaced. Thanks team.You can buy this at this budget
"
"best quality
"
"This is very slow laptop and slower than my 6 year i3 laptop which i had purchased it almost same price.
"
"This one is non performing  laptop .Every application is hanging. It does not properly shut down.Microsoft office is quite slow. Sometimes it does not start properly & starts after 10 mins. I have asked Amazon to return it.I wish I should have not purchased this from Amazon.This is my worst experience with Amazon.  They are now not taking back the laptop & they do not return & refund my money.
"
"Very bad product no one can purchase waste of money very slow performance like 1 gb mobile phone so hang Battery back up 1 hour if u want to waste your money so purchase otherwise don't purchase any item from this seller customer care said there is no return policy product not returned
"
"Please dont buy this junk product. Even I dont want to rate single star, but no other choice, i gave 1 star.Starting from booting to everything was bad... booting nearly 30-40 mins, if you click any app, it will take its own time to come back, sometimes, not coming back at all. I can't believe its i3 and 4 GB ram. very very very worst product ever I seen.even 19th century computer was good compared to this junk product. I'm not sure, how HP delivered this product? they didnt do any quality check? instead of correct spareparts, hp delived this model with scrap items?  I was an HP employee and never had this kind of worst experience with HP product. If HP deliver this kind of product, then HP share value will be zero soon. please wake up...  call back this product immediately.
"
"Laptop is good. Reasonable price for the config. Battery seems to drain little faster as compared to the description given. There was some lagging issues after startup but after few changes in setting its running fine. The Keyboard is very soft and easy to use and the num. pad makes it more handy while typing numbers. It could have been better if the keys were of different colour.Overall its good.
"
"Excellent
"
"Please don't buy this, extremely slow.. My 8 years old laptop works better than this..
"
"Good
"
"Best product at this price range.1. Weight is decent2. Gaming performance is not very high.3. I personally like this product because of Battery life. One times of full charge gives me 10 to 12 hours of backup.4. I am using this for last 12 or 13 days, but i have no hanging issues also.Overall if you don't buy the laptop only to play games then i can say this is the best product at this price.
"
"Battery life not much good, problem is the silver white body colour, easily catch scratches and be dirty easily,,, one should go for black colour body laptop  ,,
"
"Sir/madamAs per the requirements...i don't have Ms office. I don't have the bag which was already attached by the factory. So I need a immediate call from you. Otherwise I will return the laptop. Screen quality is not good.
"
"Laptop is very slow!! It takes lot of time to start! Battery backup is also bad.. No warranty card provided along with laptop.. poor display.. Msoffice is valid only for 1 month

"Ekdam ghatiya h..act like old laptop.. performance is too slow
"
"For windows 10 to operate smoothly you must have at least 8Gb RAM.The laptop is extremely SLOW and LAGGY.Buying this I ended up in regret.
"
"The worst Product i have ever bought from Amazon and has hadn't seen such a worst laptop in my life .I had bought this product for my mother three months ago. From the beginning onwards this product had been getting hanged frequently and at this point of time i am unable to atleast switch On this product. More over, it has to be noted that even though the product had on site warranty the HP service team was reluctant to do onsite service. Please read and decide before purchasing this product.HP must re-engineer this and must replace me with another.
"
"I bought laptop : HP 15-da0327tu 2018 15.6-inch almost 6 months back.  I am totally struck-up with this laptop:1) takes almost 10 minutes to boot up fully.2) Always showing that disk usage is 100% , thought i have only 10% of data in c-drive.3) Google chrome & edge browsers always hangs.Now I am planning to contact HP customer to resolve this , i hope.CORE i3 is not good with windows 10. Always better to go for i5 and above if OS is windows 10.
"
"Very cheap compared to showrooms outside.Received the brand new lappy with good packaging. Comes with pre-installed Ms Office. I3 7th generation processor. But still there are some lags while performaning normal tasks. Taking a lot of time for booting. Not recommend for gaming.

"Extremely slow machine. I only use it for ms word and the laptop is extremely slow.On boot the disk utilization is always 86 to 100%.

"If your budget is around 30 to 32k, this is a very good bye. For general purpose, this is an excellent product. For many this is slightly slow. During first time booting it took a lot of time because of a great no of updates. But after finishing the updates its performance is great.
"
"Useless productVery slow processingIt's better to buy product from a showroom, rather than from Amazon
"
"Very bad experience of the product. After using 1-2 months, suddenly one spot had appeared in the screen and gradually it was increasing. Went to service center, they are telling screen damage not fall under warranty. My suggestion is don't buy laptop and other expensive products from Amazon.

"I Ordered this lap on 17 sep and received on 21 morng.Worst delivery experience by amazon. And coming to the laptop its amazing even Better than my expectations.AMD Ryzen 3 awesome processor definitely lot better than i3 series.Its good for gaming im using it for almost 3 days its performance was very smooth and quick , im starting to wondering how they gave it for 28000. dell ryzen 3 laptop are giving it for 40000.Ryzen is giving pure graphical performance.If ur looking for midrange gaming laptop go for its best in this segment. Some guys are giving bad reviews about that dont get confused.If u utilities its full hardware and software facilities thn ur gng to love this.ill give some additional informationPros:1 Amd ryzen processor its have better multi thread performance when compare to intel i3good for gaming2 Performance u can run highend game's in this.if u upgrade ur ram to 8 GB it will run like a pro3 you have m2 slot for SSD4 Fast charging it takes around 45 min to charge 50% and battery is inbuilt5 its coming with Windows 10 life time validity.6 Comes with DVD drive and smooth finished coating.7 Light weight only 2 kg8 Price Best in segment.Cons:1 just a HD display not FHD2 Battery last upto 7 to 8hrs apprx in gaming  6 to 7hrs3 Yeah its Heating up little bit but not much.if ur well-known guy abt processor u come to know that heating and battery fast draining its a major issues for AMD.its default but im not worrying abt that .intel also have a heating problems and Ryzen is a next level processor from amd its handling heat and battery quite good compared to other AMD.laptop so don't worry abt heating.I strongly recommend this for u too

"This laptop was great value for money Since I exchanged my old laptop. If you can buy this laptop under 23k , just go for it. You won’t regret it. There are many upgrade options available for this laptop So that you can improve the performance of this laptop. I didn’t find any other laptop where I can upgrade to Nvme m.2 SSD.So I was testing my laptop for the last few weeks without the upgrade and it was performing well. But there was some issues with the gaming, Photoshop and continues browsing with many tabs opened.Then I upgraded to WD green m.2 240Gb SSD (sata speed) and migrate the Windows OS to the SSD with the WD OS Clone tool which is available on the WD website. It did shows a significant improvement in the performance. The browsing, photoshop cc speed increased but not the gaming fps. Bought it form Md computers (online) for Rs 3500.If you have the budget go for Samsung 970 evo( Samsung 860 evo for low price).The boot time was reduced to 10sec, for HDD it was around 26sec , for SSD it was 16 sec.I tried to play GTA 5 on SSD , the loading time was reduced but it’s not playable even at lowest graphics settings.Then I upgraded the ram since 3Gb of my ram was always used by the OS, So I installed ADATA 4GB DDR4 2400Mhz ram for Rs 3000 , it really improved overall performance of the laptop. Ram is now running on Dual channel.The laptop came with Samsung M471A5244CB0-CTD Ram which was capable of running at 2666Mhz ,but the laptop motherboard only support 2400Mhz Ram. I opt the help of HP forum and a computer expert to find the best compatible ram for the laptop because there is a chance of some compatibility issues.I would say if you are buying any other ram other than ADATA  AD4S2400J4G17-R , Make sure that you take the laptop to a technician so that even if the ram doesn’t support you still won’t loose your money.I tried to buy online, but if it doesn’t support means I can’t return the product.Now I can play GTA 5 with average 30fps at low settings,No photoshop editing lag ,applying filters and other effects.Pros:AMD RYZEN 3 performance is very goodCan be upgraded to nvme m.2 SSD (Samsung 970 evo the best)No overheating issues.Good viewing angle.Activated windows 10 HomeFast chargingCons:Battery life max 4hrsTouchpad not preciseNo backlit keyboardSpeakers averageRam and SSD slot not easily accessible

"I have upgraded the RAM to 8 GB. The RAM specification that you need is DDR4 2400 Mhz SDRAM. There are 2 slots, so adding another RAM isnt an issue. Dont try to open the laptop yourself as its not easy, take it to someone who knows HP laptops well. The responsiveness of the laptop has improved tremendously with this RAM addition. In case someone needs further enhancement of the performance, I would recommend adding an SSD as M2 slot is available but I didnt find the need as of now. Adding the picture of the RAM that I installed
"
"Pros:Ryzen 3 with Vega graphicsSupport up to 16gb ramDedicated M2 slot for ssdPreloaded OSAll the needed portsValue for money bought it for 22k after all discounts.Con:Worst screen of allVery slow HDDExperience and suggestion:On the initial days the performance was ok and sometimes slow.Uninstalled Mcafe and using windows defenderBest part is having addition ram and m2 slotSo 1st installed 8gb ram but didn’t see any performance improvement.Then went with 240gb wd green Sata 3 sad and cloned the os there voila OS loads in a second.So at 30k now have 12gb ram 240gb ssd 1tb hdd ryzen 3 what else u can ask.
"
"Before buying this laptop, I was using a notepad that would last over 8 to 10 hours when fully charged. So, this time, I was looking for a laptop that could stay up and working for a good amount of time. This product - HP 15 AMD Ryzen 3 15.6-inch Laptop (4GB/1TB HDD/Windows 10 Home/Sparkling Black/2.04 kg - is being sold promising that it has 13 hours long battery. Well, that is absolutely false. I am a writer. So, my basic needs (applications) on a laptop/computer are - Ms Word, Ms Excel, Paint, Google Chrome, Firefox Browser. I barely watch movies/YouTube on it. I don't play games on it. But, it's battery exhausts in just 5 to 6 hours. Talking about other features, it is very quite fast. If you have got fast data connection, websites will load in a blink. Sound quality is great. When I received this laptop, I played a few songs on it. It was an awesome experience. But, my friends, if you are looking for a laptop with a long lasting battery, this is certainly not a good to go option.
"
"Best thing about this laptop is processor which performs almost the same as i3 8th gen at a significantly cheap price. Got it for 22k. 3k extra for 4gb ram Module as 4 gb is not sufficient for Windows 10. Many who complained about laptop being slow should upgrade to 8 gb. It has changed the response drastically. No more hang ups. Adding a ssd could do wonders though have not added one yet.Edit. Finally decided to add a ssd drive. bought WD Green 120 GB M2 drive for Rs. 2280 from amazon. Added it myself. Now the speed difference is apparent in test results. system boots in 15 secs as compared to 40 secs earlier. responses have become much better. the reading speeds are good but writing not so great. I would suggest if you can spend more go for WD blue or Samsung Evo 860. they are more expansive but have writing speeds in the range of 500MB/S. WD Green is for budget users and I feel satisfied with the performance for the price paid.Edit 2 - Many were complaining about battery backup not as expected. Initially when i was using wifi and at moderate brightness i was getting 4-5 hours max. but once you turn off wifi and use it for moderate works like watching movies(not ultra 4k resolution but upto 1080p or 720p) the backup is around 6-7 hours. and while working on word excel etc backup is up to 10 hours usually. Turning off WiFi saves a lot of battery.

"Guys laptop is very good .just buy a 4gb ram and ssd slot then lappy will perform like anything .Wd ssd from amazon is available for 2300 rs buy it but check the version of ssd which fits this lappy.i got it for 22k after cash back worth it.Very fast .Touch pad is good.Battery last 4hrs with full browsing but its got fast charging so its good for me
"
"The delivery was quick , got it for a good price in amazon sale .The laptop looks quite good and also I am able to open laptop with one hand which is great  .Coming to display it's average and can't expect more .The processor amd 3 ryzen 2200 u is good and easily comparable to intel i3 7th Gen .4gb Ram is enough for basic tasks but you definitely need to upgrade to 8gb if planning to do anything more and trust me the performance after that would be great .The additional bonus is m2 slot for SSD , you can install a SSD along with ur 1tb HDD and install windows in SSD and the the magic and speed .One thing I did not like in the laptop is the sound , its low compared to other standards and the sound cracks  in high pitch voices , I ve tried updating the drivers and checking sound settings but no use .Still it's not very noticeable so I passed it and did not return the laptop.If ur looking for a upgradable laptop with good processor under a budget go for it , but only buy it in a sale , never pay 30 k for this .If budget permits definitely concider upgrading to ssd and atleast 8gb more ram , it will give significant speed boost .Have not tried any games , will update after testing

"After Using More Than a Month here is my Review.  This Hp Model only supports Windows 10. You can't install windows 7 you will get an error of Acpi is not Fully support, contact BIOS vendor. (my Bios are upto date as per vendor).For Linux Environment  Wifi will not Supported. You need buy a seperate wifi adaptor dont buy this if you are intend to use for Ubuntu or Kali Linux or any linux environment, Graphics  managable just ok.you will only get 250+MB video Ram which is worst part , you can't work o  adobe programs properly. Battery  backup is 3hrs only. Watched a full movie (2hr15minutes) at 100%  and after finishing 20% remained. Camera quality is GOOD. Display Reflects a lot not friendly. Has some Graphics driver problem which supplier doesn't accept when i gave feedback. You will get bsod error when some applications use graphics (thats not application problem at all ) purely manufacturer defect which they don't accept. Now for the Windows 10 google to disable so much of bloatware which will increase battery and performance. Use the dark mode available in personalization.  My rating 2/5 for medium type users. 4/5 for normal users.

"Amazing laptop. Beautiful, sleek, stylish and also not bulky. Performance is very fast and remarkable. Battery backup is also commendable. Crystal clear display. Audio Speaker has rich bass and hd clear sound.processor and graphics performing magnificent together. Overall hp has given a wonderful product . Thanks hp. Highly recommend from my side. Go for it. Thanks..😁😁😁

"Price : This is a great laptop at the price offered by HP. 5 full stars. Nothing to beat. It makes it all the more better deal as it comes preloaded with Win10. At 25k deal in festive sale a great price. Performance : The new AMD ryzen processors with Vega graphics match and can even beat their Intel counterparts in performance per watt. However I have no idea why HP and all other manufacturers spoil this performance with Win10 bloatware loaded on an ancient 1TB HDD. Even for a little more a 120GB SDD is so much better. So here 3 stars only for not having SDD in 2018. Have ordered an SDD and have to discard the HDDThe worst however is the screen. I don’t think I have seen more worst screen in my life. My 10 year old Vaio VGN-N31M/W had such an awesome screen. And this is what we have in 2018? Found the reason: this laptop display is 6 bit colour with RBG model. Have to give it 2 stars only ! Can’t replace screen but have to make do with external monitor!
"
"Screen is great .Yet to put an additional 4GB RAM. Removed bloat ware. Installed Firefox only (no chrome) & not using explorer . Did a few tweaks & Laptop starts fast and no hanging. Battery 4 1/2 hours only, but recharging is fast. Bought in the OCT sale @ 21999 (after 2000 SBI card instant discount + Rs 1000 amazon pay cash back) . At this price laptop is better than Core I3 laptops.

"I ordered this laptop on 10 oct and got it on 13 oct but it was  supposed to be delivered on 12 oct.so it was one day delayed delivery..but it is fine no problem.next packaging was very poor..it had no plastic air bubbles  wrapping  and laptop was delivered in rain so it got wet..I was very wooried if the laptop got damaged but thanks to hp pacaking that it was safe.coming to the laptop it is value fir money..I got it in 22000 invluding all discounts so it is best device in this range.sound is a bit low according to me .rest it hangs sometimes due to low ram but if you use an additional 4 gb ram it would work like a beast.display is average.no heating issues tillnow ..and I am satisfied with this.
"
"In this price range HP is providing a good budget laptop... Games can be played casually but not as regular basis... Ram is 4gb, so sometimes it used to hang... Better to put extra 4 gb so that there left no hanging issue. Others editing work can be done smoothly... AUTO CAD 2007 is running smoothly... Even racing game okay but battle field 4 is a bit problem... battery doesnot last more than 2 hrs that to on heavy heavy use it lasts only 1:30 hrs... Screen is awesome. HP service given is good. Inbuilt Microsoft office is there. Even in built Microsoft is awesome... Donot use for heavy games... use only for office work

"Laptop is hanging for past 2 months. It's warranty period. There is no response from Amazon , horrible service even your toll lines,not working no landline service

"Just upgrade m.2 128 gb NVME SSD and another 4 gb ram as I did, and you are good to go. After the upgrade, the laptop boots up within 5 seconds, which is awsome at this price point. The gaming is also decent, with 60-70 fps for modern combat 5. But the battery backup is not as they claim for upto 10+ hours! It hardly gives 4-5 hours. Other than that everything is fine! And yeah the laptop is light weight as well.

"Ryzen 3 is good and windows 10 with ms office is nice. Silver look is attractive and kb mouse works fine. Display looks cheap and viewing angles not good. Little bit heating like 4th generation processors. Battery life is average. Installed another 4gb stick and its performance boosted. I hope again performance will improve after installing ssd as it have m.2 bus. Overall processor is better than i3 7th generation, but gpu is weak than nvidia mx110.Review after 3 months use: Wow, that M.2 port is very good. I have installed a SATA m.2 SSD and laptop working like a charm. Zero lags with Dual core Ryzen 3!! If you wana purchase this laptop, don't miss to install m.2 SSD. I have transferred my Windows10 on SSD, and 1TB internal HDD is for storage only.

"Pros:+good build quality under the category budget laptop/notebook+No heating issues noted (had my fingers crossed until being tested for the heating issue as noted in other reviews prior to purchase)+display and color reproduction was good+touchpad response is quite good.+ Excellent Amazon customer service. (Replacement provided within a week)Cons:- The first laptop delivered had an issue with battery backup, hardly ran for 2hrs30mins. But the replacement laptop as provided by amazon Customer service did quite well of 4hrs30mins backup which by the way is far from what has been advertised as "".....upto 13hrs battery backup""- System gets slower with antivirus software installed

"Value for money laptop from hp. Better to wait for the deals and buy it for 25k. After festival deals are over, the price is showing 32k.Initially it was slow and was taking around 2 minutes to fully load windows 10. After reading rivews and suggestions, i bought additional 4gb ram and 128 gb ssd and installed it. (How to do it yourself and about installation process, you can find in YouTube)Now its booting really fast. Windows load within 25 seconds.So better will be to wait for the good deal and spend rest of the money in upgrading ram and ssd. So finally within 30k you will get a laptop which will be fast enough to compare with i5 powered notebooks. Thanks

"i bought this laptop for my sis birthday,before battery dead my experience with this laptop!!1.AMD RYZEN 3 is good for light gaming, editing and for browsing,and watching movies or online shows.2.BATTERY BACKUP:- if you are gaming give you 1 hour battery backup.document editing or video editing give you almost1:30 to 2 hr,and for browsing give you 3 to 4 hr and last watching online movies give you 4 hr,and watching downloaded movies gives to battery life of 5 hr.  !!BEWARE!! who is planning to buy this laptop after seeing 13 hour battery backup.3:-DISPLAY is the main con of this laptop..ok ok type display,only hd(720p) in 2018.4:-SOUND:- sound output of the machine is good but I'm using DFX ENHANCER,with DFX enhancer sound output is great.5:- PERFORMANCE:-over all laptop performed well if you add m.2 ssd (I added samsung evo 860 evo) for better performance and more 4 GB or more ram(1 extra ram slot available).I added (8+8=16gb)crucial ram coz system supports dual channel ram.after upgrade laptop boot time is drastically reduced from 2 minute to 8 sec...GAMING experience with this laptop is good like PUBG,CS GO,FORTNITE,FARCRY,BATTLEFIELD 1,ROCKET LEAGE,GTA 5,MORTAL COMBAT and more...overall 3.5 rating out of 5.6:-PROBLEM:-within 5 month laptop battery dead, not charging,HP service also sucks!! complaint register on 10th May but still I'm waiting for technician...they are giving same excuse  same time..sir,your problem solved within 2 days but it's already passed more than two days...I already attached pics...so never recommending hp product to anyone else..they are not able to provide services in Hyderabad metro city.. don't buy any hp product... NEVER TRUST A GUY WHO IS TELLING HOW GOOD HP SERVICE....THIS IS EXAMPLE OF HP SERVICE..

"I got this laptop for a steal. I bought it during the Great Indian Sale for only 17000, including 7200 discount in return for my old laptop. It had decent performance, but upgrading ram to 8gb has been worth every rupee. I am able to play graphic intense game like GTA V with almost zero lag or frame drops. If you're a student like me, who games occasionally and needs a laptop for browsing and general usage, go for it. However I would suggest that you wait for a sale or a better offer.

" Received my laptop. It turned on once fine but after that its not booting up.when i start the laptop cpu fan is spinning at full speed from the first moment and screen is remaining black. Won't even boot into bios. And also i checked for warranty on hp website, it's only showing 9 months remaining of warranty instead of 1 year. So i think seeler tryed to sell the defective returned product to me. Very disappointed.

"Had a harrowing time handling manufacturer and seller problems, why can't Amazon handle the warranty issues, the day the product order is placed, seller send information to manufacturer for updating the warranty. it took me 10 days for warranty update.battery is poor, display is fine, am hoping that with added RAM, it'd perform decent, currently its S.................L................O...................W, don't know how it'd handle gaming as mentioned in earlier reviews.HP customer care is also in the race for worst performance race along side IFB, Samsung, Morphy Richards and others

"I have a YouTube channel and I went abroad trip for like 20 days. I have a good laptop in which I was editing video, but for some reason it stopped working and I only have 3 days left. I searched a lot in mall and Amazon too my budget was so good, because I need some extra money too. Then finally I found this I bought it.Good and fast delivery by Amazon on just next day (Because I have Amazon Prime) my laptop arrived. Battery charging is fast and good if you're using for normal work like typing and browsing. It's handling my editing software's too which is really good for me. Yes it's slow (Of course what you can expect with 28K laptop) but it rendered my 10 min video in just 40-50 mins.One suggestion add extra 4 GB RAM and it will work so good. I was not sure that it will handle latest 2019 editing software's.
"
"Got it for 24k in a sale.Initially, I was using Lenovo z500 which has i5 and dedicated graphics card and surprisingly this laptop beats it in the benchmark. So I can say for sure that its better choice than i3 based laptops any time.4GB of ram is not enough if you want lag-free performance, I upgraded it with extra 4GB of ram and 120GB SSD and after that programs like Photoshop, Android Studio starts up almost instantly, on HDD it used to take at least minute or so and on my Lenovo, it takes significantly longer. There is no competition between my old i5 rig and this one, Ryzen 3 is owning i5 :DBattery Backup is advertised as 10+ hrs but in the real world use, it is giving me 4-5 hrs of web browsing+programming+video playback. Still best in this range.The screen is not FHD and considering price it was expected, it's good enough. I am not a gamer so can't say about its refresh rate but for my use Screen is not bad for me at least.The keyboard is very good, very good for programmers.Speakers are decent, not too good, not too bad.M.2 Slot is a big plus. Just Install SSD and see this thing blazing through anything and everything you throw at it.Ports: You get plenty of ports, USB ports seemed bit tight though. Addition of USB Type C would have been great.Trackpad is good too.

"Writing review after 7 months of use.Brought it on Great Indian Festival Sale at 23k.I usually use it for Coding and currently using Arch Linux with GNOME 3.32Pros:1. Comes with official Windows 10 Home Lifetime license2. Battery backup is good. Can last for 4 hrs with continuous usage.3. In-Built Speaker sound quality and loudness is good.4. Comes with APU. Compute intensive programs can benefit from it.5. Keys are good. Less noise.6. In-Built Camera Quality is good.7. Supports M.2 SSD. Works concurrently with SATA hard disk.Cons:1. Ram is 3.6 GB. Where Windows 10 use 2.4 GB on standby.2. Hard Disk is slow. So, boot time is long.3. F.16 BIOS update broke support for several Linux Distros.4. Due to new Vega Graphics its hard to set up several Linux Distro.In my opinion this laptop is not recommended for Gaming because of it's limited VRAM.One may reduce boot time by loading the OS in a SSD.Games can be played with a RAM upgrade.
"
"I purchased this laptop for 22k after exchanging my old sony viao for the value of 5.5k. What attracted me the most to this laptop was that the extra RAM and M.2 slots with which we can upgrade both.I never really believed in the claim of battery life to be 13 hours. Those who did are those who i consider naive. It lasts for around 3-4 hours of continuous use which i think is fair enough.Day to day apps like MS word and ppt and pdf readers are working perfectly fine as of now. My old sony had become really slow in opening those apps.However, my only gripe as of now is its horrendous display. The screen resolution and viewing angle is pathetic. If you like HD stuffs, please don't bother with this laptop. The screen is not that immersive and over that it is highly reflective, so you can't use it outside in daylight.As a budget option, it is ok, and remember, there is this option to upgrade to SSD and upgrade the RAM.
"
"Inspite of increasing the RAM to 8 GB, the speed of the machine has not improved. It's irritating to work on this laptop even for half an hour. Damn slow, Display gets freezed, opening new tab takes time..etc etc. It also have a problem of charging. It doesn't get charged while the lid is in open position. Everytime you have to put the machine in sleep mode to charge the battery. I don't know how and why Amazon sells such junk laptop. Since the replacement window is gone, could not change it. Waste of money.
"
"I am using it for for day to day task. It is exactly as i expected. Upgrades I suggest -1. M.2 SSD - will reduce boot time.2. Another 4GB Ram - will reduce lag.With these two upgrades, It will feel like an XPS or Macbook.If you do not have any requirement related to gaming or editing videos, then go for it. Ryzen 3 and Vega is actually better than i3.
"
"Initially, this was a very decent laptop. After a month of use, it began to slow down drastically. I make it a point to remove all my files every week or so onto an external hard disk to keep the laptop as empty as possible. Even after doing this, it seems to be slowing down gradually. I wouldn't think this is a very long-life kind of laptop. Have even reinstalled the OS on the laptop. It solved the problem for a about a week and then went back to its usual slow self.

"I ordered this laptop on 14th and received it on 19th. So average speed of delivery. Now as far as laptop is concerned,it is top notch as long as you dont have sky rocketing expectations.. This is the best laptop below 30k.Pros:1-Ryzen 3 is pretty fast in CPU performance and miles ahead of intel UHD 620/630 in GPU performance.2-Handles all the regular work very well, plays 4k video in youtube without any stutter. I use it for day to day purpose.3-It can handle gaming quite well(at 720p obviously) if you add another 4/8gb of ram as 4gb ram is quite low for playing recent games. 4gb ram is not even adequate for windows 10 nowdays ,leave aside gaming. So if you want good stutter free performance, get atleast extra 4gb ram.4-I have used it for emulation purpose as well and have got very good performance in pcsx2 & cemu( both of which are very cpu intensive). Intel doesnt play pcsx2/cemu well enough even at lowest settings. Intel gpu is not supported by cemu. So if you are into playing retro games and have a limited budget,this is your best budget option.5- Its very premium looking laptop with sparkling black finish.6-Has two USB 3.1 ports which provide very fast transfer speed.7-Has M.2 port(which is much faster than HDD) for upgrading storage which i am planning to do. Shifting the OS to M.2 will give serious boost in performance. Most budget laptop dont have this facility.8-Metallic finish around keyboard which gives it premium look.9-Pretty loud speakers10-No heating(gets just little warm on full load)11-Good screen12-Not very heavy- its 2kg which isnt much considering that its a 15.6 inch screen.13-Charger is very light weight. It becomes important when you are carrying it daily for 1 hour on your back.Cons-1-Pathetic webcam, but thats normally found in most laptop. This is one thing i dont understand that why manufacturers dont add good webcam. Nowdays we have 20-24 megapixel cam in mobiles, so why not add a good webcam in laptop?2-Not so great viewing angles on screen. Also screen is very reflective,so causes problem in day time as lots of reflections create distraction.3- Maybe this problem is with my unit only but USB ports are very tight. I have to struggle to insert or remove any USB cable etc.4-Not soo great battery life as has been claimed in the description. Even when i have used in most economic way possible , i get around 6-7 hours battery life. Though it is much better than normal laptop, but still much less than claimed 13 hrs battery life. Maybe it can be acheived in future by optimization of BIOS or driver.5-Wobbling of screen when it is carried in hand.Overall, its a fantastic laptop for the price. You will be pretty happy if you dont have skyrocketing expectations.

"It's been a couple of weeks since I got this laptop and so far so good touch wood. After 8 years of using a Mac I decided to return back to HP with my first time using Windows 10. I must say I am impressed with its performance so far. The good thing is I can upgrade the RAM which I plan on doing soon simply because I'm a tech geek but in no way does the installed RAM make the laptop lag in any way. The Ryzen 3 processor is also nice and slick too. Just make sure to routinely update the preinstalled device drivers and in order to make sure you get all the device improvements. Overall it's good for work, gaming, web development etc. The battery is quite decent too for such a lightweight lappy.

"Due to less Video RAM i cant even work with Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 it shows no enough VRAM..it shows pure performance in Asphalt 9..Build for midrange games..even high range with a decent gaming performance.. battery life is almost as mentioned if there is no network connected..it doesnt feel much heavy..i bought it in great indian festival sale..Got for 23990..for that rate its awsome..im sad about that VRAM issue..

"One month...good till now...the disk is on the slower side.....installed the WD double notch ssd and added 8 gb kingston 2666 ram.... Now working like a charm....still the total costed below 30k in total. Hope the inside picture help
"
"Ordered this laptop on the 24th Dec and got it on Christmas Morning!I was expecting the performance to be on the slower side considering that it only has a 4GB RAM on it, but I am pleasantly surprised to see that it is quite fast. However, I will still add another 8GB RAM to make it a total of 12GB, cause that more RAM the better it is.Will also upgrade to the 240GB WD Green M.2 SSD and migrate the OS to it, cause it will definitely boost the performance.Having said all that, I would certainly recommend this laptop cause right out of the box it is great and good value for money. Plus it is highly upgradeable as compared to other laptops in it category and price point.AMD Rocks!!!
"
"First of all it isself not a complete laptop but it gives you options to make it a good machine. Which you will not get on other laptops under this price.Hardrive is extremly slow. Though it shows it 5400rpm but blevive it works like a 10 years old harddrive worls.Boot is extreamy slow. Takes around 1 minute to turned on completely. (i have. Removed AV and HP product software which comes preinstalled)Copy process is also slow.Good part is : you have M.2 slot. So you can M.2 SSD hardrive for OS and believe me you will see more than 10 times difference in boot time as compared to his own disk.Second good thing is that it has 2 memory slots where you can add up to 16gb memory. I small problem which i noticed is that the memory is ddr4 ram with 2666mhz which higher than what they have mentioned in to the specification. and if you are planning to upgrade memory parallely then please buy a compatible memory.Rest everything seems to be fine.

"It's a very good looking laptop at this price with ryzen 3 onboard.Also there's Windows 10 and Ms Office 2016 included.Performance wise its acceptable at the given price point.. Day to day tasks are handled easily with minimal or no hiccups.Upgrading to extra RAM and SSD should help in a much better performance for sure.The battery is pretty average which is okay considering the price point.. Should last you between 3-4 hours on moderate usage.Display is antiglare so no strain on eyes or headaches expected for prolonged sessions.Keyboard is tactile but the placements of keys could have been better.Installed Pub G lite and played one match... It is playable but don't expect buttery smooth performance.. Upgrading ram to 8Gb should help.Dual speakers are adequately loud for a closed room.. The volume from headphone jack is amazing.Overall a pretty solid offering at the current price of RS 28900.. If offered 2k discount during sales then it will be a killer deal.Surely recommended to upgrade by investing 5-6K to SSD and higher RAM.. Will be doing so in diwali time and will post my second thoughts then.

"I had high expectations about this.  After reading all those good reviews I decided to go with It. But Its terrible. First thing that I notice is the display. Its plain bad.  Not at all HD as described. It looks like 360p at the most.The pages are all pixelate.  The display really looks like what people would have used in the eighties,  when Steve Jobs and such visioneries were working  on it.  But It seems this product is yet to move on from that and its stuck to this Damn which might have looked OK 35 years back. Its still under 10 days replacement criteria but the Guys at amazon are not responding well. Then I discovered the second problem, this time one of the keys on keyboard does not seem to work and when I checked,  Its damaged and what looks like a hardware issue. When I contacted amazon, I was told to update the drivers from HP site. Tell me, how can you fix what is clearly a Hardware issue by downloading softwares!!! This IS THEIR SUPPORT or if you may call it that.Yet I installed all the drivers and still hardly any improvement.My Question is - Amazon, What is this!I have been buying  since 2015 using this ONE account, thats more than 3 years, almost overlaps with Amazon's beginning  here in India. SO I do think I deserve better. Thats It

"As reviews say it IS slow. My 2006 build Compaq (XP OS) with just 256 mb RAM used to load image file in millisecond. This one with 4 GB RAM takes about 3 to 5 seconds. That XP OS was of CD size (less than 700 mb). This one's security update alone went to 6 GB.  These days the OPERATING SYSTEMS are heavier and slower. It seems. Must be because of heavy protection mechanisms. I am just a computer user not a technical expert. I don't know what is what. Some said upgrading RAM to more GB speeded it up. For less than 20,000 this laptop is a good buy. Battery lasts upto 6 hours +. Mc Afee anti virus is 1 month  free. With just ₹600 you can buy for 1 year ( choose one device option). Win 10 has ""lifetime validity""USB PORTS TOO CLOSE ??? I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS. SUCH SIMPLE FACTOR THAT HAS WENT UNNOTICED BY HP AND NO FEEDBACK COMPLAINTS ABOUT USB PORTS PLACED TOO CLOSE ON ALL LAPTOPS, ALL THESE YEARS. On the left side, this laptop has 2 usb ports placed too close. You can never put two otg sandisk flash drives at the same time. The first one will block the entry of second flash drive. How they put 2 usb ports that close is a matter of concern and why they were not pointed out by possibly millions of users worldwide. Designers must have separated two usb ports atleast by two or three inches.Make sure to switch on the option not to install any software from outside the Microsoft store. One unauthorized program (not in Microsoft store), can download more programs by itself and ""stall"" the already slow laptop. They happen in background, you don't know what is happening. For two or three days, I suffered moving to every level in minutes time not seconds, switching system off by force pressing the power button on laptop and again restarting. I UNINSTALLED ALL PROGRAMS FROM OUTSIDE THE MICROSOFT STORE. This made the system workable. There is nothing wrong with MCafee anti virus program. It only protects.  There must be a strong reason why HP itself recommends MCafee anti virus.There is no light indication that the laptop is ""ON"" on keyboard. One must press either the caps lock button or mute button to remind that the lap is running. These days people are preoccupied and absent minded. They tend to forget whether they switched the lap off or whether it is ""on"".  The screen display goes blank after few minutes idle period, one must look sideways on the right to see if the light is glowing but most often they don't do it, causing the lap to be running inside for no good reason. A light on the keyboard (near spacebar) would be better for all laptops

Ex below1. Right click from desktop and opening ‘New’ submenu takes around 30 seconds2. Opening multiple browser tabs in chrome makes system very slow3. Settings tab takes around 20 secs to open.Overall not satisfied with the performanceThe positive is battery life.======further update : I have now started facing intermittent wifi disconnection issue———-After using for quite some time now, I am giving a 1 star now as there is no option for a zero star. Utterly disappointed with HP. This is the 7th laptop in my life and the worst one. Agree that the price is less but that does not mean that you can compromise on quality. Still the laptop is dead slow. Takes over a 2 minutes to just open google chrome.NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED

"One practically useless laptop that's good for literally nothing. Will freeze with just 5 tabs in Chrome loading low graphic trading charts. Not good for even using as a word processor - 3  word documents will cause it to continuously freeze. Losing so much time everyday because of this. Made a mistake because I was on a budget. Even if you don't have money and buy this as a budget laptop, please save and buy a better configuration or pay more and use EMI for payback.

"Laptop is good but dead slow RAM 4g not enogh.HP should describe required RAM for normal operation.Only started working for normal use after diabling disk write coach and uninstallatio of virus software provided with laptop.. can use laptop for day to day use. Only RAM upgrade to 8gb wil help laptop to normal.

"I'm not a blogger to write about something so intensely to be honest I'll write this one. It's jot that this is the first laptop I've used nor will be the last but I've very bad experience. It says AMD with high speed and so many other positive points but trust me. You'll regret. I replaced twice thinking manufacturing issue but noop. The laptop and the processesor itself is worst. I'll freez you screen, lags, hangs and takes several minutes to start your computer. If u click a start menu itll take 30 sec to open. Don't mention opening 3rd party app. It'll take forever or freezes and the pc will restart itself. Once u connect with Bluetooth device than be ready to press the power button because after 5 minutes your pc hangs and mouse cursor freez and nothing can be done accept pressing power button directly. Took a help from Amazon technicians, Hp technicians but nothing could be done. There are no number of points to mention what is problems. But there are unnamed problems I've never come accross in my computer experience.If u don't truust me in this than later you have no points of getting regret. Don't buy ryzen AMD. Go to intel cores
"
"Very worst product, I just used one da and I updated all the drivers, but still the laptop is very slow and the major thing is I got dot in the display... Which is really very major problem... Display quality is too bad... And now the TouchPad is not working.... I really didn't expect this from HP...
"
"Not deserves even a star it's normally takes 7 minutes to start , I am professional my usage limited to browser, Ms word and watching videos or music though it's take too much time.Upgrading is must or else you feel working in grandpa age also not that easy in this upgrading removing panel is daunting task.My core 2 duo starts and work faster than this , unfortunately I purchased 2 Laptops seeing there endorse of 8 hrs battery etc and it's a big trap.Such big international company HP not cared about it's growing brand in market or trusted customer, just for the sake of selling this junks troubling customers.Go for any other laptops in range of 15k instead of this you will be more satisfied instead of wasting valuable time on this junk.
"
"Very disappointing with the HP laptop . Hard disk got crashed with in year where the laptop usage was  minimalThis product already a problem with Hard disk was crashed within a year of purchase. Which is very disappointing. And it was told that inner boards of the laptop are very old boards, when checked with hardware repair person. But actually we have bought a new brand device from Amazon ,  also this laptop comes with one warranty which is till November 2019,that means the date of purchase was in November 2018 , but the warranty says only till September when with HP company. Miss match of warranty dates
"
"Not working properly and speed is very slow. Battery life is very short.Amazon is not helping me to return this product.

"On registration on hp site it show 10 months warranty instead of 1 year. Product already registered on hp website before 2 months. How strange

"good laptop in a budget but pretty useless without SSD upgrade and ram expansion. Hangs like anything even with mild browsing and light multitasking .but the good thing is it has m.2 SSD slot and dual channel ram for expansion.  UPDATE:  BOUGHT SAMSUNG EVO 860 OF RS 3999 AND ADATA DDR4 RAM OF RS1599 FROM AMAZON AND UPGRADED IT. BELEIVE ME THE LAPTOP WORKS  LIKE A BREEZE  ,THE BOOT TIME IS REDUCED TO 25 SEC FROM 2 MINUETES AND LOADING TIME IS ALSO QUICK. SO WITHOUT RAM EXPANSION AND SSD THIS LAPTOP IS USELESS WEIGHT BUT WITH IT ITS A BEST IN BUDGET SEGMENT
"
"As most of the points covered earlier - regarding the importance and need to upgrade the ram to 8 gb - else somehow this laptop is much useful ( the OS itself takes close to 3 gb or ram ) - noteworthy I also bought one more Asus laptop same day with intel p - however the battery life and ram usage is much better ( considering its price point and both have same OS / 4gb ram / hdd ) - apart from that I don't see any benefit of this laptop over my other laptop. My usage is usual browsing / movies / bit of office work ( ssh terminals / C programming etc ).However the benefit in gaming is evident - its much better now and doesn't hang/crash.Overall - warranty support is so far good - HP support does hear and try to solve the problem.I guess its imperative that extended warranty needs to be purchased.Hope it helps - Thanks
"
"got the laptop on sale for 22k after all discounts. seems a good value for money product for regular everyday use (not heavy computing or gaming).mcafee seems to be coming preloaded on a lot of laptops these days and it does eat up a lot of cpu and disk utilization and makes the laptop slow/laggy. need to uninstall mcafee and install an alternative like eset or avast.noticed that it doesn't have an easily removable battery (like how most conventional laptops do). one probably needs to unscrew and remove the entire base to access the battery and other components like the ram and hdd. so i wonder if the battery is easily user replaceable... will know once i open the base panel off in a few days.also wanted to upgrade the RAM, but unable to get the exact ram spec (tried the bios and speccy) and it doesn't show a brand name. i guess i'll have to physically open up the base to get access to the hardware and see what i can do about it.definitely would do much much better with 8 gigs or ram and an ssd.
"
"I purchased this laptop during diwali sale. I have been using this now for more than a month and I find it complete value for money.AMD Ryzen 3 processor is better than Intel Core i3.I even upgraded my RAM to 8GB and now all the processes have become very fast. (At 4 GB RAM also the performance was good).Another advantage is the availability of the M.2 SSD slot. No other laptop in this range has this provision.Overall, I will suggest to go for this laptop.
"
"laptop is good as expected. needs 8gb ram for better performance. there is no extra hdd slot fyi. nothing much surprising about this laptop. got very high fps while playing dota 2. very good. Normal battery life(4 hrs)  normal weight.
"
"I would like to inform everyone that please please dont buy this product.. I know u are here in need of A cheap and best laptop but this product is really very cheap but this is A worst product, trust me it is far better to buy laptops from their respective stores rather online.. I have bought this product and then I realize why they are selling it for only 19990 it's actual price is 22000 this laptop is an old model of E2 SERIES, so please i request u dont through your money here instead of this you can see it offline ...
"
"Overall I'm happy to have this machine. Just one fear I have is the heating issue of this processor. It heats up too much especially when we do multi tasking for little longer duration. I am hopeful that it'll not create any problem for longer run.Its performance is almost equivalent to i3 but graphical performance like medium load gaming works even better on this one than the i3 processor, but heating is a big time problem. If we do multi tasking especially playing games or watching movies or videos for long time then laptop heat up much. Once I had experience weird problem too when it got too much heat it play weird sound for few minutes and then restarted.Battery life is  not so good. Yes it'll charge very quickly but it'll exhaust like the other hp machines. The claim of having larger and efficient battery life on this listing page is not true at all.
"
"I bought this laptop during the great Indian sale for 22k, it was delivered fast and well. immediately after delivery, I upgraded its ram to 8gb (as win10 is quite sluggish), and started testing it out.I played the following games on it on low settings.1. pubg mobile (emulator)  fps :30-402. csgo fps 30-603. FIFA 18 fps 35-1024. fortnite 33-425. GTA 5 fps 30-456. rocket league fps 907.dota 2 fps 608. dirt rally fps 80-100this shows that it performs very wellbattery charges super fastand drains superfast if you play games , lest it gives long backupdisplay quality is okayspeakers are okoverall good package in 22k
"
"Good laptop for the price 23000 rupee plus 1000 Amazon cashbacks. So final price 22000 rupees. Good for Ms office and browsing. May not be good for programming using heavy editor like visual studio etc. Light weight, battery backup 5-6 hours with medium brightness. Didn't check gaming and all.
"
"I bought this laptop as it was very cheap and came with RYZEN 3 processor. I wanted mid-range optimum laptop for all the work including daily use and photoshop and after effects. Due to Microsoft Windows OS the lagging is there, however if you add 8GB more to lap of SODIMM 2400MHZ RAM then 12GB in total would help latop do any work you want without interupting other work and distributin of threads for work is awesome and handelled well by CPU.As I do not play games, I do not know how good the graphics part is, however it helps after effects very much faster than my old laptop. Thankx to HP. Thankx for the seller for this price.
"
"Good product with good pricing, sound quality is high which is good.
"
"while this laptop is only a moderate gamer, one really should not be stepping into a 26k product expecting ROG level gaming. if you want a killer gaming rig, set the 26k asode in your bespoke custom PC fund thst you'll be able to finally cash out three years later. if you just want to build a few houses in Minecraft or Terraria, this will do.the trackpad is responsive and the typing is absolutely enjoyable.Windows 10 has largely calmed down with the updates, and some features are... better... than Win7, as much as I hate to admit it.overall, a solid starter/typist laptop, but splurge on something with an actual graphics card if you want gaming.
"
"Handy and light weight. Serves basic purposes of a laptop. Wouldn’t recommend for gaming though. Ryzen gets you through multi-tasking and can run multiple applications simultaneously.Out of box warranty was 3 months. Spoke to HP and they extended the warranty to one year.MS Office is only a trial version.Decent battery life, typical laptop display. All in all a good value for money buy.
"
"Hello guys..After 3 days consecutive usage I'm writing this review.What I liked about this product and dislike.Pros and cons..1. For a generic purpose, or learning, education, coding, manual small businesses this laptop is more than sufficient. In terms of build quality it gives a premium feeling which I personally like the glossier look of this jet black laptop.2. Wide screen with less bezels which gives a hepatic feeling for watching videos on YouTube or any other social media. It also gives a very bright colorful eye-catching output for watching movies.3. Now let's talk about inside the laptop..Related to this built in apps, it gives lot of apps for free to use. And most of all the usable and necessary apps are already there which you will need in your daily usage. Like if you talk about Microsoft Edge web browser, it is also very much fast and responsive. Unlike the Firefox it doesn't lag or consume much data.Cons..1. Battery life sucks, I mean really it sucks, less than 4 hours with fully charge. But one thing is good charging time. It gets charge withing 2hours. Thanks to its fast charging.2. Graphics are ok. Not complaining material.3. So many updates for Windows 10. If you have a hotspot it will consume all your data in just one hour.Overall, it is a very good stylish looking laptop.I would recommend you if your budget is less then 30k.
"
"Excellent Product in this Range and its with Window 10, Decent 4 GB RAM extended upto 8 GB with 1TB Hardisk and the processors are also nice. Its Light Weight, supercoo, Looks Smart, Easy to carry. After searching many products in this range i had finally decision about this product. Such a nice product by Amazon and HP. Thank you.

"Better than i5.
"
"I got this under 25k . I have been using since 2 months and don't have any issues with it yet. I haven't upgraded the RAM or anything , sometimes starting up can be slow , but for the price , I think this laptop is really worth it.I use it for browsing and other daily tasks.The display is nice and big, speakers are pretty loud enough, even video calls are quite clear. I am very satisfied with my purchase.If I find anything else worth mentioning, I will update this section :)

"Pros:Display is goodSpeaker output is okayLight weightBattery backup is okayGood HDDCons:Heating issues are thereTaking lot of time to load the windowsSuggestions:For Windows 10, it better to go with 6/8 GB RAM

"The laptop is extremely slow and laggy. The issues start within the first two weeks but in my case they were after the return window. One of the laptops restarts randomly a couple of times each day. The customer care team also is unable to help. The process to contact HP and get the warranty clause activated is painful and so far (30 days+) I have not received the required support. I would strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this product. I was an ardent HP fan but will not be purchasing their products anymore..
"
"The laptop is great except for one item. The keyboard design is really poor. The silver topped keys with grey lettering are near invisible. The Function keys are numbered in miniscule font (that too in grey font). I think the regular designer went on a holiday while the keyboard was being designed.  I really would like to give it three stars only due to this huge factor in efficient usability. You need to have a light shining directly on the keyboard to see the keys properly.  But otherwise the machine is great.
"
"Not at all recommendable .Very slow in all aspects and you can not upgrade further this system.Five minutes work will take one and half hour approx.

"Worst product. Hangs a lot. Heats like an iron box. Windows 10 is not at all compatible. Now after 1 month it is showing boot error. Battery back up is only less than 2hours.never buy this product. Go for Intel laptops that too from the store.

"The product is ok but speaker did not work from day 1. I cannot understand how such a basic defect gets even pushed out. BTW I was delivered a non booting laptop 1st up and Amazon promptly replaced a new one but it has the speaker issue

"Worse laptop...my old Acer D270 mini laptop with Intel Atom processor is performing better than this piece of garbage..Using this laptop.. You can not even open 5 - 6 tabs on your browser... While opening apps it take about 40 seconds to response...Dont buy... RYZEN 3 is more slower than Intel Atom processor..... Vega 3 graphic is there just to fill the configuration... Not useful at all.

"Screen quality is not good. You cannot view it from different angles. Only straight view. No lights on keypad hence cannot type in low lit rooms. Becomes slow very fast even though ample Ram memory space.

"Update 16-10-18 - alright next update. it works smooth as butter. I will provide some step wise alterations to be made that will speed up the laptop.1.Uninstall Mcafee. Windows defender is capable enough to protect from normal threats unless malicious sites are opened by user. In that case use AVG . its pretty light on RAM2. Then go on control center - windows update and keep running updates,restarts and boot ups until it shows that no further update is available. Similarly do it for HP assistant. It will download all the drivers required for the laptop. This ll eat some 2 hours of time but very necessary.3. Once all updates done - Go to task manager. From there to start up and disable which ever process you don't use like Microsoft one drive etc.4. In task manager go on view tab and update refresh speed to the highest.5. In start bar in computer/ windows management manually update processor speed to 100% while on battery or on AC power.After all these setting you will find laptop boot up real nice in under 30 sec and no lag while operating in multiple windows or videos or heavy word/ excel files.Updated rating to 5 star now11-10-18 What a grt PDT. Crashed within 3 hrs ..So much for comparison with i3 ane i5 . Now amazon won't replace till an engineer visit after 2 days to see wht I posted in here...Ll update after 2 days !

"This is worth the money except it cannot handle 4k 2160p very well but it can handle 1440p HD very well. It's good for simple gaming and not expecting much with graphics but wanna have a smooth experience in playing it. And it's good for daily life office work too.At the end I would say well you should try investing into something like this with these features
"
"Worst experience with Amazon. I used the laptop after some time I charged it fully and switched off after some hours I tried to on but it was not turning on so I plugged in the charger the laptop turned on but battery was showing 10% lol. Tried to return the product they don't even have any policy to return the product also seems something is broken inside the product.

"Its a good product considering the price. Solves all purpose like not so heavy gaming, multi taskings, browsing and other activities. Those who do not have heavy usage can easily go for it.
"
"Good build quality and stylish design are impressive at this price. But when it comes to usage its utter waste. For example if I open Chrome browser it takes about 30 seconds to load and when I type something to browse, it is not appearing instantly its taking long time to appear. You should take long breaths while using the laptop. Very good laptop for meditation practice:)

"Awesome laptop with this budget.The laptop is fast enough and battery life is average so don't get worried,sound quality good, design is impressive,but ram upgradation is suggested in future for more better performance but still enough speed with default configuration.Don't go for any i3 7th gen processor just got for it!

"The Laptop has a decent display, boots fast and does what it should for the price. However, the Microsoft Office mentioned in the listing is a 30-day trial version. However, the vendor conveniently mentions that Microsoft Office is available without providing any hints that it is a trial version.When I called up Amazon Customer Support. I was told -1. The Product only has a 30-day trial and that this has been clarified in an User Answer. There are 4 products and 3 user answers. Completely not appropriate2. I was asked to purchase the license for 8k.This is a complete cause of Deceptive Advertisements by the vendor.
"
"Dont buy this, in 3 months  of time, hard disk conked off.Laptop is pretty slow .Have to incur an expense of 5k to get a new hard disk.Amazon should have a larger period of return window for sensitive products like laptop.Actually  a loss to buy this laptop from the seller.Better to go with offline stores like Croma or exclusive dealer of the brand.

Original windows 10 & Ms office 2019(Life Time).System is pretty fast in terms of booting.Those who are complaining about Ms office 2019 for 30 days, first understand how to activate Ms office 2019....1. First create your own outlook I'd like how we are creating in Gmail, Yahoo....2. Then Left side bottom search box, just type  Excel and click the Excel.3. It will ask you to activate.. just click activate and enter your outlook username and password, what you have created or already having.4. Enjoy for life time..5. Meanwhile don't click office 365, bcz its not for life time...I hope you will enjoyReview after 15 daySystem is superb. It's very fast in terms of opening Ms office,GC,IE... No lagging...Those who complaining about hanging... Update the system even bios also...Once it's done you won't find the lag...Meanwhile don't expect the speed when you're booting first time...31/10/19 updateWhen I clicked ❓in the right bottom, opened HP page. Where I got the 4 updates. It seems, it's very important update for bios, Bluetooth, lan and wifi. Those who are complaining system is slow, this update may helpful...

"This laptop is sleek and lightweight. The product startup post shut down is very slow.  Probably because of windows 10 and just 4 GB ram.  The unlocking of laptop post startup takes approximately 3 mins and is slow.  The laptop is just fine for browsing and not more.  You cannot take up work for heavy excel sheets or cannot play games as well. The web pages too take time to download and you will experience a lag of 30 seconds.  Sound quality is better as compared to other laptops at this price. Overall just a fine product for browsing but not more.
"
"From the reviews, I purchased this laptop only to regret it later. I contacted amazon for return but they told me a 10-12 step solution to make laptop faster which I implemented. The laptop did become a tad bit faster but returned to being the speed of the first generation computers in the world.Now I am frustrated using it and would highly recommend to not buy this laptop.I don't know if Amazon can help here. My INR 30000 wasted in this utter disappointment of a product.
"
"The HP laptop, 14 inch, light weight and genuine softwares is a perfect combination for anybody who is in search for a decent laptop.After couple of days of working, here is what I found,Pros:1. Windows 10 & MS-Office 2019 both genuine2. Light weight, quite handy if you have to carry it everyday3. Island keys for keyboard, if you have a lot of typing as daily core then it works very smoothly4. Alphabets are engraved with broader font size5. Decent display, webcam and battery life of about 3-4 hCons:1. The smokey gray colour of the lappy is certainly hopeless so that you think to return it on the same grounds, jet black could be excellent option which seems to be unavailable at the moment on Amazon with the present configuration2. Performance is bit on the slower side considering the configuration though addition 4 GB RAM can boost it. However, not a serious problem3. Hardware though light weight seems fragile and of low quality4. Not for heavy gamersVerdict:Certainly value for money. I've reduced two stars for the design of the lappy hardware otherwise perfect companion at the cost.

"Do not buy hp products... Service is just waste.. To replace a faulty part already 20 days over without any further updates.. This is my experience and if you buy it.. You can experience it also..
"
"I have taken this laptop 3 months back, and it was quite horrible in the beginning.The speed was so slow that even I needed to wait around 30-40 secs to open a small size excel file. I even tried contacting hp but did not get much help as it was screen sharing session.I consulted one of my friend to it, he helped me out in increasing laptop's speed, he actually removed all unwanted/unnecessary software which were pre installed. Like, McAfee (Not needed when you already have built in Windows defender), some unwanted game software and then he did fragmentation in order to utilize space holes in memory.It really worked and I am able to use the software which I need in a quick of time.You can try this to increase the system performance. Hope this will help you out!
"
"superb laptop with win10, ms office, all preloaded and 8gb RAM/ 256 GB SSD. Very quick to boot and no lag. Dropbox giving 27GB space free with this and One drive gives 5 gb space So all one needs is an extended warranty ( bought for 1500 on Amazson) and a optional Pendrive ( bought a 64 GB) for storing documents etc. Bought in exchange so paid Rs.23,236 ( Rs.4760 for old Sony Viao plus some SBI card discount), so really happy with my purchase. Good screen and battery backup. Only miss not having a backlit keyboard, rest all is great!
"
"In the first 20 days mouse was not working had to open the laptop and got fixed easily but what's the point? Also I beleive the HP quality is gone down. This laptop screen  does not open much its just till 90 degree. Also the original pro e shown is high and then it make you feel as if they are giving you high discount but it's the actual price.. Not happy with the quality
"
"I hate the thing that in the ad they say Microsoft Office is free where as it is a silly one month trial for that its not worth it far more better options available please either provide the lifetime MSO or else my order is up for return
"
"I am a software professional and I like this product for its light weight and faster booting time. However I can not like its camera quality. it is very poor. After 4 days when I booted it started its own updating of BIOS straight from HP and for reasons I could not understand . At the same time its OS windows updated itself which is not a surprise. Some of its claimed features like integrating with my mobile on an instant basis is NOT happening even after several attempts by me , which is not surprising considering Windows commercial nature and its cunning features. I do not know  for what reasons but sometimes it suddenly loses its contact to internet by wi-fi which feature  I am  using on regular basis as a default one. I bought it because its has MS OFFICE which updates itself because it has come loaded with it. Otherwise Microsoft breaks your computer if you had loaded it from your friends CD. I tis very fast ,very light and jet black colour is very attractive. Arrived one day before in good condition but they should have supplied a bag for free.
"
"This is one of the best laptop in this price range, also there is some confusion related to MS office trail version, i purchased this laptop 2 days back and i conform it has MS office 2019 student version for life time free.Just go for this!!!!!!!!!
"
"Display very poor qualityBuild quality poor just poor plasticKeyboard not so softPerformance averageAs a brand HP it's look like so poorIf you are paying 27k or 29k for this laptop you should go some higher range laptop with good full hd display if IPS is the best.If looking for normal work go with lower range with less RAM but you will better display keyboard and build quality.But don't buy this display is jerk.
"
"Pro: In exchange i got this lappy with i3 7th gen, 256gb ssd, 8gb ram and original win10 & ms offic, weight 1.4kg @ ₹24200/-. In this price i consider it worthy of purchase. Looks of the laptop is also good.Cons: Poor web cam, Screen quality is not good, its avg, not backlight keyboard & speaker doesnt produce bass much.Overall all looking at price and the hardware specs i m very happy. Photoshop & video editor works fine. Good for student & office going people. I switched from asus x200ma to hp 14q.As per configuration of this hp 14q its really fast. Boots up in 2-3sec.
"
"its been almost 4 hours I am using this Laptop and trust me I am loving every bit of it, its handy, looks cool, sleek, its beautiful, its light yet super fast. battery charges quick tons of good things, 256GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM are the main highlights the only thing that could have been better is the screen but then its under 30000 so not a big deal HD+ display is still good enough.thumbs up and thank you HP, thank you Amazon.
"
"Didn't worked like new laptop even 1 day . From the date of purchase it didn't worked well as it has very very slow performance and i contacted hp support many times but they did nothing and i myself tried to reset it and failed then gone to hp care and thry said that window is corrupted u have to pay rs. 400 for cloud recovery, i have to pay for service even in warranty,wtf is this?? Worst experience with hp. If you face u any problem on 1st or second day then pls return it. Other wise u will get irritated from hp service.😑
"
"I bought this laptop especially for the reason that it had MS Office included. Apparently, the procedure to activate MS office is to call HP customer care and they will take the remote connection and activate it.Its been 2 weeks since laptop is delivered and I have made some 10+ calls to HP customer care each of which is of 30 min+ duration and still, the MS office is not activated yet.Terrible experience after buying a brand new laptop from HP.
"
"Thin and light weight , this laptop is quite good . Performance is also good. Windows 10 work smooth. The set up is automatic and very easy. The display is not that great but for the price point quite acceptable. Overall a good buy.

"Unbelievable laptop, for this price point there is no match available. Sleek, light weight, super fast. No point spending large sum of money on other brand. This by far one of the best product for this price.
"
"CONS -Its just a day old laptop but start showing its signature of slow processing..It takes more time than usual to start and shut the PC and also sometime it slows down in responding to the Feed Input.Display Quality - I m bit worried about the display quality as gentle press at the back of display can be seen on Display with merge of color at the spot (when pressed).Pros -Battery life is Quiet Good (upto 5-6 hours) N can be Fully charged in 1.5 hoursSpeaker Quality is GoodLight in Weight n Compact in SizeI will rate it 3.5 Star based on 2 days of Usage.

"This is the new model by HP and got the deal in Great Indian Festival at 29,990. No issues in Warranty, Windows 10, Office. All are original. Laptop boots in 5-7sec due to its SSD feature.If you are planning to buy a laptop for delicate purposes like office work, watching movies, youtube, listening music, this is the perfect choice. Don't go with normal HDD laptops, it will be slower afterwards because of its mechanical functionality.I will modify my review after 7 days of usage.
"
"Please don't buy this Model. It's just waste of your money. I bought this with so much expectation but all gone. Only 2 things are good in this one is light weight and other is battery life rest nothing to tell.
"
"Well the laptop is quite good. Battery life is average... It lasts about 4-5 hours. It is amazingly light. Laptop looks very premium. Processing is also good. But it is ideal for casual use. No problem is faced during web browsing, watching movies, editing documents, etc. Overall it is a good one. And of course it is ""value for money"".
"
"Been using it since 1week and its working fine. Display is good, sound quality is superb, takes a few seconds to boot and it functions very quick and smoothly because it has ssd which is the biggest plus point. I didn't find the battery life very long lasting but it gets charged soon. It met my requirements both in work and entertainment purpose. Overall its a go for it product at this price range.

"I am writing this a few hours after unboxing it (8GB+i3+256GB SSD+ windows 10 + *?MS Office?*)MS Office. Biggest mystery. The description says free MS Office lifetime. Reviews say only trial version available for 30 days after that INR 8,000. Well, guess what?...*Drumrolls*Free Office Home+Student version for lifetime.Now what does that mean?It means life time free excel, word, powerpoint, one-note. With all updates. What a sigh of relief it was. (By the way, I've not bought this on Amazon- just referred to Amazon's reviews)On opening the laptop, there's a sticker below keyboard saying ""don't forget to activate MS office home+student""Well, it's not straight forward. First create a Microsoft account, follow some steps and after that only.Apart from that, the boot time is mind blowing!Sound is loud. Display not that great (feels inferior). Keyboard feels and looks rich. The buttons seem a bit slippery but fun too. The page up and page down buttons are differently placed (check out Google images). No backlit :(Will try FIFA 17 in a week and will get to know more.Hope this review helps.

"I am writing this review after one week of purchase, the laptop is sooper light around 1.5 kg, it feels like you are carrying a notebook and also it boots very fast within 10-12 sec because of ssd drive but the build quality could have been better, you will get trial version of ms office for 30 days and you need to buy after that...keypads are not upto the mark and the screen display quality is just HD not full HD but at this price segment this cons should be fine. I am satisfied with the performance of this laptop. Good for students or daily users but not for the gamers or heavy software users like autocad, photo editing softwares.. Hope this helps.

"Not worth more than Rs 19000.Don't fall into the trap of buying this alptop at any price above Rs 19000/- at which it was being sold by Amazon and its rival ecom company.The laptops price has been pushed up to make the i3 model look like a great buy at Rs 29000 which too was being sold at Rs 25000 earlier.The laptops are basic with plastic body and basic components build quality.It is worthwhile only if purchased at a price range of Rs 18000 to 19000 else go for lenovo with Amd being sold at Rs 17-18 k currently.

"For the price this is the best SSD laptop one can find buying a laptop with an HDD is just naive when u can get tons of storage using an external drive. The screen is also decent and much better than I expected but would have preferred a full HD display. Battery life is poor as one gaming session drains the battery low. The laptop is quite light and comfortable to use. The camera is poor to say the least.

"Pros:-Really nice laptop-Quite fast. Boots in less than 10 seconds.-Screen quality is decent.-Battery last more than 6-7 hours on medium brightness. Average usage-Sound is satisfactory.-Value for moneyCons:-Cheap plastic body. I am scared to carry anywhere.-In less than 1 month, print on keys is faded. Poor quality print.-Webcam quality is pathetic. It's like a vga camera-Adapter is heavy. Almost weighs 70% weight of laptop. Beats the purpose of portability.

"Wonderful product for such a price. I got it for an effective price of nearly 17,000 ₹ and I'm delighted to have it.Pros -- Good battery life. Lasts for around 4 hours.- Lightweight.- Doesn't lag.- Price is great.- Trusted brand.- Durable and excellent for daily use.Cons -- Not suitable for high end gaming.- It is DOS, hence you've to install Windows by yourself.
"
"I bought it for my personal use & i'm surprised how it performs. It's super lightweight though battery backup isn't good, might last for 2 hours after a full charge. Switching between tasks is super smooth & no lags even when lots of windows are opened. This is where AMD quad core processor shows its jalwa. I installed windows 10 & it's working awesome. At this price point its supercool product. I got it next day because i'm a prime subscriber. Others might get it late. Go for it, its a jackpot.Note: do check if its covered by hp warranty because in past many people have faced the issue with hp products bought from Amazon. Hp guys say they wont provide warranty for any product bought from Amazon.

"its not working properly i need to return the laptop urgently , there are lines on the display of laptop, it did work 10 days only. after that we are facing a lot of problems with it, can you please my product or take return, i am requesting you to take return or get repaired .  how can we get warranty of laptop from HP company ,where we go to get repaired.
"
"Lightweight. HP laptop in less than 20K is worth a deal.The only gripe: I bought in offer period, and noticed that the price changed after offer period to a lower one. Not fair Amazon !The warranty was already found to be updated to the month i bought (Sep) of 2018.Was easy to install softwares.

VGA, USB and HDMI ports are already rusted.Moreover, as per their policies, I will have to coordinate with technician to inspect the product so that complaint can be raised. Product photos aren't sufficient.As per HP website, the warranty was started in June 2018.Will update on basis of response I receive from Amazon.

"This laptop with AMD processor is low budget home use laptop come with DODPreinstalled  os you have to install win 10 64bit os and download the necessary drivers from HP web site.It's moderate laptop for using net surfing other office work. Display is moderate and low end hamming can run in this laptop.
"
"This is a very good budget laptop. I bought this for my dad. Hardware spec are just right for daily basic usage, office apps, movies etc. Screen is good quality. Viewing angle is better than most lappys in this budget.Thing to remember. This doesn't come with OS. Also it lacks bluetooth. But you can go for a ₹200 bluetooth USB adapter and work with it.
"
"Build quality is good. Battery exhaust fast . AMD processor is a bit slow. Once you buy you can't return  cab be replaced on , so check it before buying.  Overall not so Happy
"
"Not even 06 months completed. It's battery became non functional. Laptop doesn't work without electricity ON. Tried to claim under warranty but HP denied for the claim. Worst experience ever.This may be due to design of battery. (Protrusion of battery from the even surface)Laptop's overall functioning is good.
"

"You just need to buy/install the Windows 10 and it works perfectly. Not recommended for any person who does not know how to install new OS.- A6-7310 is better than 3rd/3th gen i3 processors- Build quality is good at this price range.- No back-light for keywords, so be aware of the same.- It has Optical drive, VGA Port, HDMI, 3X USB, SD Card reader, Bluetooth, Camera- 3.5 mm headphone jack is awesome, as you can simply plug your mobile headphone and even mic will work.
"
"Good product for 19k.. no issues with the processor or hardware.. I ve been using it since 3 months.. good for students. But the problem is that driver software for usb 2.0 ports unavailable in hp software site.. i had to download lenovo drivers to make it work.. no any other issues..
"
"Wifi connection is not activated even after several times drivers installation. My all efforts are gone in drain and still not it is not working. Online HP help center still.unable to fix this issue. Waiting for the service man to visit personally and fix it.
"
"Based on a week's experienceGood product for the price.Using Ubuntu 16.04Pros:1. Decent amount of RAM: Almost all regular progs runs smoothly. Some heavy files eats up memory though.2. Good graphics: Runs steam based Hitman (2016) game. Though it is expected with A6 APU.3. Decent build4. Good battery backup. Gives around 3 hrs backup when streaming videos with wired internet.5. No problem with cooling till now. Let's see how it holds up in summerCons:1. An hour more of battery backup would have been great2. 14 inch screen is a little small.For now my verdict is that it is a very decent laptop for the price.
"
"worst built quality i have been using this since last 3 months it  is got a crack near the keyboard and also the battery locks are not working properly(one of them is not working et al)
"
"Within two months the mother board got damaged. It was replaced under warranty but the next day cooling fan stopped working. Raised a case and waiting.Edit: Cooling fan was also replaced under warranty. So promoting the rating to two. But now the OS crashes (blue screen) very frequently (twice a day); not sure if it is a hardware or software issue.
"
"Really awesome product,in this price range. I've been using this from last couple of days and I didn't face any lagging issue neither heating issue. I would recommend if your budget range is between 20k
"
"I bought this from Amazon and using since last one month. Till the time no issue found with this machine. Anti glared screen is great and also smoothly works with all applications. I am using Windows 10. Bettary back up is also appreciated it's about 4 to 5 hours for continues  use. Very light weight and slim. As per budget it fulfills all the requirements.
"
"Laptop is delivered within 3 days without prime, thanks seller.Product is very cheap and good performance. Touchpad is not responsive smoothly in windows 7. Overall excellent.For better performance replace HDD into SSD and upgrade RAM to 8gb or 12gb or 16gb.
"
"I buyed this laptop on Axis Bank Credit Card with 24 months EMI. But my first credit card bill with this product EMI includes the complete amount into the statement. Bank says the seller got delayed into converting the amount into EMI and the complete amount is generated in the credit card bill. Whoever has delayed but now I'm in a fuss.
"
"Its a very good product, good value for money. I have been using for 3 months. It doesnt have keyboard light, so using it in dark is a problem. Bt other than than everything is covered. Good for basic uses, even programs also can use. Not good enought for android development cause its amd cpu, arm based system image is very slow.
"
"The product which has been sent to me has a defect that the left side 2 usb device connector is not working at all which is used for the connection of a pendrive, charger or like wise device. As the time of return has been passed  even I can not replace  it now. So what can be described more, it is looking very nice but it just extinguishes the fire of my enthusism.
"
"After researching a ton, I settled on this laptop. Don't let the price fool you. It is solid. I added an extra 4gb of ram to the laptop and now it flies. For those interested...it has 2 RAM/DIMM SLOTS but only 1 is used (4gb) the other is free to add an extra dimm to. also make sure you use DDR3L (low voltage) as im not sure the regular DDR3 voltage would be motherboard compatible...the stock dimm was a Hynix DDR3L 4gb (hynix is hyundai's electronic division). Boot up on win 10 x64 bit is 7 seconds max. The extra ram really makes the computer zip through processes. I've had no heat issues, and no glitches so far after a month of use. I love the weight/solid finish with a pseudo brushed metal type of artwork around the touchpad areas. It doesn't feel like cheap plastic. The AMD A6 is one of the best processors and has a great long life if you take care of them well. I have an older A6 dual core that is still running well after almost 6 years. Of course you have to clean your laptops vents from dust and keep it in a cool place and your AMD A6 will serve you well!. Don't waste your money on an overpriced INTEL I3 i5 etc generation processor...its a complete waste of money. Plus intel has had lawsuits in the past over faulty soldering of processors (just google it).... The only things I didn't like were that the keyboard is fused into the laptops' moulding which makes cleaning the keyboard harder (thankfully i bought a keyboard protector but still this should be designed better as a removable keyboard), the screen is ok and it is great that it is anti-glare (matte finish) by default but dont expect an IPS HD screen at this price point. This is more for presentations/students/moderate office work stuff...I haven't tried gaming on it but I wouldn't expect a high FPS on this laptop.Finding drivers for this pc is a bit of a pain...but it can be done....first install the HP Support assistant and follow along as it checks your pc drivers and warranty etc...or you can look for a similar HP laptop with a similar chipset....and use the drivers from its support page....like the HP 15g 221au drivers some of them work for this pc .....Oh forgot to mention as an audiophile you will love this laptop's sound quality (speakers are located on the bottom where you're wrists usually rest....but the DTS sound application along with the REALTEK sound driver (they make the best sound cards imo as a long time user).....will blow you away...don't expect solid thumping bass as its unrealistic to do that...but the sound clarity and volume loudness is very good compared to other laptops....put in a good set of over the ear headphones and play with the DTS settings....(which turn off the default generic windows equalizer) and you will be amazed at the sound clarity and bass produced via the DTS application.the webcam is really good and great to do basic skype or photo snaps with....This computers bios if I remember correctly also allows VT (virtualization technology) so those interested in virtual machines or other simulation software would be able to do it with this...The DVD drive is a slim dvd writer....with a small profile and quiet when spinning/readingIt has a Rj 45(lan port), vga port, hdmi port 1x usb 3.0 port, and 2x usb 2.0 ports Touchpad is responsive but not made by synaptics (Elan touchpad) which is a bit of a downer as synaptics makes the best touchpads....but this gets the job done still.....no issues with trackspeed or movement...Bluetooth is very good uses the realtek chipset and connects on the first shot...no issues there...realtek wifi chip is very good as well...can get signal from 3 floors down (in a concrete house with rebar and several walls btw) you just need to make sure you get a good wifi driver for the card to work really well as the default windows driver only gives like 1 bar whereas the realtek driver gives you 4-5 bars of signal strength.....plus settings you can manipulate via device manager/control panel....I recommend getting this laptop if you are on budget and also buying a keyboard protector (saco brand makes it)....sure this laptop is about 2 years old in terms of chipset (probably mid 2015 to 2016 in terms of the AMD A6 7333 but at the price point along with what comes with it in terms of ports and chipsets its well worth it! Go buy it!If this review was helpful please click the LIKE / HELPFUL button! Thanks! :)

"Great laptop for the prize. Will give it a five stars if it was delivered with Windows 10 installed
"
"Took 3 days for delivery. Laptop is not the best and there is a noticeable lag here and there. But, in this price range, it is the best you can get. Battery life is superb and you can use it for most softwares.... Don't buy it if you use heavy coding softwares. Otherwise for normal company use, it is good.

"So its been 3 days with this laptop an i have no complaints so far yet there are some stuffs that could have been better and done well. let compare each aspect of this laptop one by oneBUILDi bought this laptop to carry it when am in a vacation or outdoor most and in this part i have to say its a firm one and light weight but what i noticed is the whole this feels so plastic. there is enough place to rest you hand while typing but i really felt the need of keypad back light when i was doing my work in dark. the top has some really good texture with hp logo. though there are three USB port but none is 3.0. there are led lights for both webcam, on the right side of the the laptop coupled with HDD led notification and surprisingly LAN port light.on the right side there is our usual CD reader and writer. keypads are tactile and clicky. on the front side there is card reader and on the left there is 3.5mmjack and HDMI and at the back u can swipe back the battery from the down sidePERFORMANCEi bought this laptop for my daily coding and making presentation and stuffs. with AMD A6 and G4 Radeon i didn't so any lags our massive slow downs. though i strongly recommend that heavy software like ADOBE and games like GTA 5 should be left out.yet it is to be considered that since its AMD some compatibility issues with emulators is expected(updated) i have not yet installed any antivirus so far since defender seems to be pretty good. yet after installing adobe photoshop it started lagging. games like company of heroes tend to lag a littleSTANDBYbattery tend to lag 3 to 4 hours depending on the usage though i have an average opinion about the battery.it can be detached by sliding two locks at the back bottom of the laptop and pulling the pipe battery out.SCREENscreen seems to be bright enough with anti glare which seems to be good outside though sunlight shooting straight may create difficultyCAMERAit is equipped with  a one mega pixel camera with a microphone which is quite a decent one. it is good when photo is taken in enough lighting but when it comes to low light it is prone to distortion. it is sufficient for video chatsSPEAKERspeaker are bedded at the bottom front of the laptop which i would rate 6 out of 10. they are audible finely when there are no noise but when you are outside with disturbance they are not audible at allVERDICTthis laptop is good for its compactness.if you are an average user and need to do productive works like working on excel sheets or make presentation this is a fine choice. the only say i have is about the plastiky finish and performance which when considered with money seems OK

"​I wanted a laptop not more than 14 inches with good performance, option to upgrade RAM and good battery. In my previous experiences, most of the laptops start demanding maintenance and repairing from 3rd year onward and after that it is a never ending phenomenon and you spend a good amount to get it serviced.Battery and hinges are the most prone parts and cost you much to get them replaced. So, I didn't want to spend more than 30k for any laptop and  my maximum life expectancy from a laptop would be 3 years.My first preference was Thinkpad which is known name for sturdy business grade laptops. The cheapest model of Thinkpad (E450) with i3 processor was available at 29k at Amazon, but that seemed to be a waste of money when the better configuration was available with Fujitsu (A555) at around 22k on Amazon. Though Fujitsu seemed to be the best option in terms of value for money, but the 15.6 inches, weight and uncertainty of its repairability after warranty period was one of my concern because of which I didn't select the Fujitsu. Then I came across this hp 245 g5, particularly this model with 7200 rpm hard disk and AMD A6 processor. I did lots of research online after which I found it the best option in terms of value for money, built quality, longevity and repairability after warranty. Till I received this laptop last week I had great apprehension about the performance and built quality of the laptop as this model is comparatively newer in market. I ordered it on 7th October and for Prime Members the expected delivery date was showing 8 pm next day, but I received it around 10 pm (2 hours late). Here is my review after 7 days of usage.​Performance​My first concern was how this laptop would perform. I have been using intel i3 4th gen before with 4 GB RAM before. Compared to that one, this laptop of hp outperform with speed and usability. Windows 10 boots up within 15 seconds of power on and log in takes another 15 seconds after tweaking start up programs. I didn't expect it to be so quick given this price. The HDD of 7200 rpm + AMD A6 processor + 1600 MHZ RAM of 4 GB rocks!Features & DriversIt has a graphics card which performs fairly well and full HD videos play without a flaw. I haven't bought this laptop for gaming, but other applications like PowerPoint, Word, GIMP opens quickly without lag.The built in DTS encoder comes as a bonus.The driver software is very simple and clean without too many tweaks which makes it easy to use even for novice users.The keypad is also smooth and have a little curve in the middle to give it an ergonomically smooth usability. The keys also looks good and the caps lock light is built within the key itself. The brightness and other function buttons work without the press of Fn key as well as support other functions like Alt + F4. I am still figuring out why have they provided a separate Fn key in the keyboard (must be for other Operating system than Windows 10).WiFi works fairly well in Windows 10, but it is recommended to install WiFi driver from hp personal support centre to avoid frequent disconnections. After installation of the driver, the wireless connectivity issue was resolved (requires restart). Install the software from hp's website and it will automatically recognise your system and help you install the drivers. Alternatively you can also download individual drivers from hp website where they have catalogued all the drivers for this laptop separately. It was very easy.Built QualityThe reason I chose hp was because of the built quality. The good thing is the body is more or less same for this model even if you go for higher configuration. This essentially means that hp do not compromises with the built quality for lower configuration laptops as is seen in other brands. The body is sturdy and of good quality plastic. It nowhere looks like a cheap laptop from any angle. One of my major concern was the built quality, for which I am quite relieved.DisplayThe screen is anti-glare display which is actually unexpected in such reasonably priced laptops. However, the visibility from different angles is not so great as with most 14 inches laptops which are actually meant for business uses. IPS screens are normally found in 15.6 inches screens on which are typically meant for gaming and multimedia programs which it is not.BatteryThe battery is really good at this price point. It comes separately and is externally mounted. Full charge can give you over 4.5 hours in battery saver with minimum uses to 2.5 hours in maximum usage scenario. However, the battery backup may vary depending on usage, screen brightness and USB usages. Overall, the battery performance is competitive to the market and one should not be worried much about it.WarrantyI saw many people complaining about the warranty which is showing from August, 2016. I tried to 'dispute the warranty' option which was showing in the hp assistant on my laptop. I therefore called the hp customer care support (teh toll free number is written on the sticker of the laptop). The hp support team asked for the Amazon's invoice, serial number of the product and snapshot of the laptop's backside with serial and product numbers for verification. Within 24 hours they updated my warranty from the date of invoice which I am able to check from the hp online warranty check. So, don't worry about the warranty, and contact hp customer care support to update the warranty.ConclusionThis is the best value for money laptop if you want a laptop for normal day to day use and office work. The option to upgrade RAM is another option which is hardly found at this price point. If you are a very heavy user of multitasking, you may consider upgrading the RAM later. If you have limited budget, want a sturdy built as well as good performance-go for it!

"Here Is my in depth review after using this laptop for over two weeks# Build quality of the laptop is very study.# Keys are widely spaced (relative because my hands are pretty small) and there is a good feedback from the keys while typing( I did have some issues while typing with regards to the placement of the FN key and the Ctrl key. I keep confusing one for the other and it just gets some getting used to)# Power cable is pretty long and has a convenient velcro fastener to coil it up# Battery life is quite long about 5-6 hours and recharged really quickly#Webcam quality is pretty good#Sound quality is really good but kind of quiet at full volume in noisy environments. I would just pair it up with a Bluetooth speaker when needed.#All ports are  as depicted in the product images and are quite comfortably placed.( I however did find that the headphone jack was a wee bit tight for my liking)# Screen is really good from all viewing angles.# The laptop""s wight ( lightness) surprised me compared to the Monstrous Lenovo G550 (my previous laptop). I selected it after much conteplation and weeks of online research & comparisons.Did get an email from HP via Amazon re battery recall issues about a week after delivery, but when I input the details on the HP site, this model is not affected.

"I bought this HP laptop during offer period in Oct 2016 (Great Indian Festival) with cash back of 15℅. Superb laptop in this price range (18.6K - 2000) . Comes without Windows. Installed win 10 and is working satisfactorily. Using it for internet, movies, and other programmes. I already have 15.6 inches HP Lappi with me but this 14 inches is too light & extremely good.
"
"i will try to be as frank as i possibly can and give a comprehensive review about his product.i gave it a 5 star rating as it was exactly as described and it is the best product by far at this price range!!i would like to quickly mention something a lot of people get confused about! this computer is a free DOS 2.0 OS. Meaning that it doesnt come with a preinstalled Windows or any operating system! If you aren't acquainted with installing an os by yourself this probably isnt for you! Personally i prefer linux over windows and so i installed the latest ubuntu 16.04 os on it and it works really well!!the screen- 14'' it is the perfect size! especially if you plan on moving around with it and using it in while traveling or in a car and so on its not too big and not too small its just the right size!  the display quality is really good.if youre looking for a bigger screen (15.6') with similar configuration then theres another laptop by hp that offers it-HP 15-BA025AU 15.6-inch Laptop (AMD A6-7310/4GB/500GB/DOS/Integrated Graphics).IF you're worried about the ram being a little too less (4gigs) the laptop has 2 ram slots that can be expanded upto 16 gigs of ram!!THis is a budget buy as its a laptop under 20k. but at this price range an amd apu quad core processor is a really good configuration!!its graphics card are the integrated are radon r4! which is a very decent graphic interface!! not suitable for HQ gaming but perfect for videos and other media!!AMD A6 is famously known for how quitely it runs and I can confirm that this laptop is much quiter than i expected!The OS- based on your preference you can install either linux or windows i went with linus as its a much better smoother and bug free interface!! I  didnt have any problem with the wifi or usb drivers as linux took care of it all (ubuntu 16.04) and its free so thats a plus! if youre a windows user you might run into some driver issues but you can go onto the hp website and download and install the drivers which should resove most of your problems!!th battery life is 4.5 hours which is AMAZING. the 500 gb hdd is good enough as i have an external HDD as well! the sound isnt great but if youre using headphones it wont matter! the build quality is satisfactory and its a very neat product!!  everything functions just fine!! overall its a very good product esspecially at this price range its running very smoothly and connects to wifi no problem! also the usb ports and vga port function!I hope this review was helpful!! To sum it up!! if you know how to install an os and youre looking for a decent laptop in the price range!! of 20k this laptop or the HP 15-BA025AU 15.6-inch Laptop (AMD A6-7310/4GB/500GB/DOS/Integrated Graphics) is what youd want to consider!

"Wonderful productThings i liked :1)Looks - Especially Grey striped finish on top.2)Screen - Matte finished looks premium.3)Performance:  Is not bad. But i suspect it is having RAM management issues. People having problems with drivers , download HP Support Assistant.4)Warranty - to update your warranty , Contact HP through call or chat service .Give them invoice copy and photo of the serial code on the back. They will update it promptly.5)Cool - Laptop doesn't heat at all... Surprised it is cooler than an Intel processor.Things i did not like1)i had problems running ubuntu on it.I had issues with WiFi. The processor was at 10% in all the four cores, but it was slow.. Maybe something to do with memory management for both processing and graphics.Shifted to Windows 7.2)Sound is very very low. A budget smartphone has a louder speaker than this.3)Keyboard itself, comparing with the (14 inch)inspiron series of Dell, this keyboard is a pain to type.ConclusionIt is a budget Laptop, comparing with (14 inch) Dell Inspiron laptop , it definitely comes out on top in build factor and looks premium.I do accept some reviews pointing out that AMD A6 as  it is faster than i3 (dont know gen, maybe 5th). If you are using it for exam preparation or interview preparation (go for this). Coders should probably take Dell 14inch Inspiron with Ubuntu preinstalled.
"
"For the price I paid, I have zero complaints. It exceeded my expectations. Super happy with the buy.Pros:1) 14'' laptop for this price is commendable.2) Display and viewing angles are good considering the price.3) Performance is satisfactory for normal/daily usage.4) No heating issues so far.5) Considerably quieter machine.6) Sound through speakers are really good.7) Battery is good.8) Lightweight and easy to handle.9) Very decent keyboard.10) Responsive touch-pad.

"1.Only 14 inch laptop available in this price range with decent config.2.Performance as good as i33.Installed win 10 home without any issuesCons1.On updating graphic/display driver the screen starts flickering.You need to format again to make it usable. Couldn't find any reliable graphic driver update from amd or hp site.But the one installed as default with win 10 works without issues as long as you don't update it.2.warranty period was already started 2 months before the purchase.But got it updated with the help of hp customer care.

"I bought this laptop few days back, used same day delivery option. Amazon delivered it on committed time. Packaging was decent not excellent. Product is matching with the description given on product page. I would give it 3.5 star.Proving my feedback after using it for few days,Pros:- cheap laptop.- configuration best in this price range of 19500. Fujitsu could be another good option with a bit higher price. But I was doubtful about that brand and service.- I installed ubuntu 14.x on the laptop. It is working seemlessly without any lag or issues. I started Firefox, chrome , downloads , youtube videos all togather. I did not observe any performance issues so far.- good option for day to day usage.Cons:- one major issue is with the wifi signal range. It can connect to my wifi if I keep it within 5 to 6 feet distance from the wifi router. It doesnt even detect wifi if I keep the laptop in next room. This is causing lot of trouble. I have to use mobile hotspot to get connected if I am away from wifi router.- mouse pad is of cheap quality. The buttons on mouse pad are hard and makes heavy clicking sound. Keyboard is good though. Navigation keys are cluttered as others suggested but I got used to that.- build quality of screen panel is not so good. You might have to handle that with extra care.Overall decent product. I would have given 5 star if wifi range would have been same as other devices.

"Value for money...got this laptop in 18,500... was bit afraid buying a AMD processor and not so very high reviews...ordered it..and have to say it is a very nice laptop..at least for this price...works like a charm...with even high end games like Modern warfare and all.... thanks amazon and HP ...

"Here is my review after using for 8months...Excellent everyday laptop if you intend to use it for MS Office, browsing and watching videos. Speakers are weak...don't expect much from it. Managed some short length video editings too. The matt finish and the anti-glare screen is impressive. Coming from an HP Intel I3 laptop of similar specs, I couldn't tell much difference in performance. This is my first AMD PC ever and given the price point, it's a thumbs-up. And yes, it's true that only Windows 7 and Windows 10 drivers are available from HP website. Also, please download the HP Assistant software on it after installing Windows. It will tell you the Warranty status. Checking on HP website showed warranty as 'Unspecified' whereas in the tool it revealed that only 10months warranty left. Took me a while to get it sorted with Amazon (impeccable) support! I run Windows 10 without any issue.

Runs all my programs and four year old games without any hiccups.Runs Chrome (10 extensions loaded) with 30 tabs open, PDF and Word 2016, Internet Security suite and Outlook 2016 in background without any lags.Recommended for all users (except high end gamers and designers). You can download official drivers from the below link of HP website:[...]

"I ordered this lappy for my daughter as her birthday gift .At this rate HP branded laptop with 4GB/500GB config and a 14inch display looks good to me..I loaded Windows 7 Ultimate , the only problem I faced was with the 2 USB ports provided on the left hand side , both were not functioning despite me having downloaded Drivers from the HP website . I suggest HP should at least provide a CD containing the required Drivers .As regarding the product , the sound output through the speakers leaves much to desire . Laptop battery lasts for upto 4 - 5 hours , which is ok for me , recharging is fast , it takes only about 1.5 hours to get fully charged . I am satisfied with the product .As usual Amazon delivery was as per schedule , I recd the laptop within 24 hours of placing the order .

"for the price range , I can definitely say the laptop is superb.Here the Pros:1. I usually use this laptop 10-12 hours continuously for my work  but no heating issues2.

AMD 6 Processor is very good compare to Intel i37. Looks premium as the build quality is very very goodCons:1. Sounds is low2. Video quality on the screen is average even if you play HD VideosIf you are looking for a Laptop under 30K then definitely go for it. 100% Value for Money

"Extremely satisfied with this product. After using 2 days, this is my review :-Pros :1. AMD A6 is good for internal use. Obviously this laptop is not for gaming purpose. I bought this because of my some office work and other activities ( like watchimg movies, browsing internet, video chat etc. ).2. It has 3 usb port and 1 hdmi port alongwith cd/dvd drive & lan port.3. Screen is good with 1366x768 standard resolution. I played 4k video for testing & believe me its running well :-)4. Battery backup is good. I charged it full in the morning & it gave me 5 hours backup ( watching movies & browsing net ).5. Windows 10 home edition running flawlessly without any lag.6. 14 inch led display is pretty good.7. Light weight and small in size. I carried it along with 1 tb wd hdd, its charger, 1 oneplus power bank, a small notebook & tiffin in my 15.6 inch sling bag without any problem.Cons :1. Sound is not so loud ( but i think in this range its ok for me ).2. Its black colour easily capture fingerprint over it. So you have to clean it regularly.I bought it for 19,469/-. At this price range its too good for home usage if you are not a gamer. Amazon delivery is prompt & comes in a good packaging. So, go for it.
"
"Using since last 20 days very good production, no problem with wifi, display, speed, LAN, mouse pad, all functions working fine.Only you have take care of you install a good OS and Antivirus software. It is working well with WIN7 and Quick Heal AV.Looks decent good for home as well as small office.Pravin Mandlekar...

"This laptop is only for personal use.If you want to do heavy work such as video editing,photoshop or some heavy softwares then do not buy this laptop.You'll get good laptops for those purpose in Rs.25k+.So think before buying this laptop.
"
"Bought this laptop 2 days back, I installed win 10 pro. Working fine so far and battery back is good. I was looking for a laptop not more than 2Kg since I travel a lot, it meets my requirements.  I doubt whether the product is refurbished or not, coz of the warranty period. Amazon service was good and the packing was also good but not the best coz the secondary packing by Amazon is very loose the primary box is shaking insode the secondary box, that may cause transit damage. Will update later...

"Best purchase ever.ProsNon reflective screenMatte finishExcellent batter backupResponsive mouse pad4 GB RAM is sufficient for moderate usage, also can expand upto 16 GBLight weight and 14inch screen makes it easy to carry on journeys.Have CD/DVD drive, which is an add-onUSB 3.0 port is also provided.Many people where telling that getting suitable drivers is very difficult, Easy way is to install ""DriverEasy"" software, which gets all suitable drivers and all you need to do is to have a good broadband connection and sit-and-enjoy.I installed Windows 10 and laptop works like a charm, no complaints not so ever.

"I received a used product. There are scratches on the touchpad. Also the laptop was partially open. There is gap between the hinges and is not in proper fit. Din't expected this on Amazon.

"Its Good for Students and For Individual Users for clerical work like word excel PowerPoint etc...Intall device drivers from official website of HP and also download  AMD app for better performance.You don't need to update BIOS.

"Review after one week of use. Looking premium. Very light weight and easy to carry. Plastic quality is average. Display clarity and colour reproduction is good. Processor is good for normal computing. I installed genuine windows 10 64 bit OS. All the drivers are available and working perfectly. 2ghz (boost upto 2.4ghz) quad core processor giving enough speed for my works. I installed windows 10, photoshop latest, ms office 2013, quick heal total security, nero, picasa, google chrome,other apps and players etc. Till now no lag or anything, Running smoothly. Check laptop warranty online in Hp website and if it is showing less than 365 days in warranty, call the customer care and follow the steps they tell. Its not an issue. Ram is 4gb, always 1.5-2 gb is free. Can expand upto 16gb (1600mhz ddr3l ram). If expand by a  4gb or 8gb Ram, will get more smooth operation. Hard disk is 500gb 7200rpm. Which is fast in loading. Can replace by 1TB. 1 USB 3.0 and 2 usb 2.0 ports are there. Also Dvd drive available at this price is a good deal. Graphics is Radoen R4 integrated graphics is enough for normal usage. Not good for higher end gaming. Great part is its battery back up. If optimized brightness using, I used to get about 6 and half hour back up. Definitely will get 4 - 4&haf hour back up. Battery is taking 1&half hour for full charge.. First con I noticed is, indication light is missing in charger. It may avoided for cost cutting. Caps lock indication light is there in keypad it self is convenient. No heating issues, even after continuous usage of 12-13 hours. But power and wifi indication lights are fitted on side are not easily visible.. Speakers are fitted in bottom, and not much loud. But its enough. Best buy for below 20k. Don't expect accessories and i7 like speed at this price tag. I selected it after long search in online. Amazon delivery was fast by 2 days and well packed.

"Review after 7 months of Usage:-Please don't buy any HP laptops as I have been following up with customer care for an issue.  I am not getting any response from customer care and no one is seriously looking into customer issue. I want to replace my laptop monitor, But no one is responding after I contacted them 10 times.PLEASE STAY AWAY from HP.-------------------------------------------------------------------Review at the time of purchase:-It works as expected. But clarity of the screen is very poor.  Doesn't look like HD also.  I bought only for the brand as I don't want to faces issues.Whoever buys any laptop, Please check before you buy whether the brand is giving drivers for the OS you need to install. Particularly this laptop comes with only DOS, I have installed 32 bit windows 10 and all the required softwares from my side. But when I checked with HP, they have all the drivers only for 64 bit os and not 32 bit. Again this is a problem to me.

"A value for money Netbook under 20k.Giving some suggestions here as 👍🏼 ( pros )are already discussed here.1) Works flawsless in Windows 10 64 bit OS.2) Please Update drivers through windows update.3) Install AMD control centre through amd website4) 2 USB ports will not work due to driver issue in  Windows 7 Ultimate. Use only Windows 10 64 bit or latest Ubuntu Linux.5) Please upgrade ram to 8GB for buttery smooth performance.6) Performance at par with core i3.7) Photoshop and other rendering softwares working smoothly.8) Seller didn't provide netbook serial number in invoice, which might be an issue in warranty claim9) Warranty already started in June 17 2016 as per HP online records. Please contact HP for change in warranty period with the copy of invoice.10) If affordable change HDD to an SSD, which will improve overall performance.This netbook covers all the basic needs. Highly recommended because of great battery backup and low kerb weight. No need to spend 10k more for i3.Great Netbook @ an awesome price. Bang for buck for normal and medium users

"
"Its ok to satisfy your desire only.After buying it on the first day it hangs and i used to open its battery for shutdown .On 3rd day it also hanged. Anyway its good to browse and work in ms office.

"Laptop is good all is fine but you will not get installed Microsoft like any other windows not any antivirus software you have to buy it different ..all is good

"Good  laptop this light weight  good one its works with windows 10 with but how to install another sound but too low sound
"
"I had ordered this product, because the specification was too good. But performance wise very very worst. im unable to play videos and couldnot perform any task, its keep on hanging. Disappointed very much. Also when i verified Serial no on HP portal, it says warranty till Aug 20th 2017. But i bought this lap on sep 25. Dono why this was showing like :( (it should show sep 25 2017 as per one yr warranty). Doubted they had provided me the used and defective laptop. This is my first bad experience through amazon.
"
"Its a very gud laptop in low budget..easy to carry💖..since i have bought it it never dissappointed me...👌
"
"A great product to buy.Pros--Excellent built quantity(body is Matt finish hence less prone to scratches)-This AMD processor is beast.-Battery backup is quite nice.-Windows 7 works perfectly fine on it.-Mouse sensitivity is perfect.-Nice chunky keyboard.Cons-- Volume levels are on a bit lower side.- Finding the drivers for the laptop is a little trying to win the battle of panipath.- 4gb RAM is just the adequate don't expect much from it. Mine is eating up 2gb RAM at idle time also. Upgrading it to another 4gb would be a great help.
"
"Thought to be an amazing option from HP at this price. Processing speed will take you back 10 years. You can try to upgrade RAM to 8GB. Keypad is nicely built. The touch pad is just average, but that can be overcome by using a good mouse.As a user, in my experience, this machine is for very basic purposes and internet browsing. Not advisable for business softwares. If you are willing to spend a little more, go for Intel processor based laptop.

"The HP 245 G5 is a good laptop in terms of specs and for the price. It feels well built and has a good service backup from HP compared to other major brands.If you are planning to get this laptop for heavy processing or gaming stay away. AMD processors have always been priced well compared to intel, .The processors have always been ranked higher in terms of features, so most users get impressed and end up purchasing AMD.As some of you already know AMD processors have always had heating issues and the A6 was no different, the CPU does have heating issues and this issue persists even during normal usage like browsing or watching movies.The G5 is not a bad laptop, as it boasts good build, above average display and good battery.If you are planning to purchase this laptop i would recommend you other laptops available at the same price soon at the end of the review. but if this is your second laptop and you would use it for very light weight tasks you can go for it.These are the issues you can have after you purchaseTHE LAPTOP DOES NOT COME WITH WINDOWS PRE INSTALLED :this does not come with windows preinstalled so installing a new one would cost anywhere close to 8000 rs which would bump up the price to 25k plusDDR3 :the laptop comes with DDR3 not DDR4Due to heating issues from the A6 CPU I would recommend you to consider the following models :click here http://amzn.to/2wRRdpL  ==>  has windows 10 preinstalled same priceclick here http://amzn.to/2jgjTpz  ==> if you can increase your budget and dont mind purchasing windows 10G5 is a good laptop for those looking for a laptop which can perform lightweight tasks and want something which would offer you peace of mind support, but there are better models at the same price you can consider.Hope you found the review helpful to make a proper decision.cheers

"I bought this laptop (HP 14q cs0018-tu) for 19k INR in July 2019 on Prime day. It's really fast because it has an NVMe SSD with read speeds exceeding 1 GB/s! Windows 10 boots in less than 5 seconds. This is probably the cheapest laptop with a fast NVMe SSD (Toshiba KBG30ZMV256G). The Kaby Lake-R Pentium Gold processor 4417U has 2 cores and 4 threads and is more or less equivalent to a Core i3. The laptop is thin and light, and the keyboard is decent. The charging brick is also small and portable with sufficient cable length.The major downside is the screen which is a sub-Full HD (1366x768) panel, but that's quite OK considering the price point. The other downside I noticed is that the two speakers are not symmetrically placed, but that's just nit picking.Overall, I'm really happy with this laptop. It's great for web browsing, productivity/office work, and light programming.  Easily the best laptop in the 20k INR segment and will handily beat more expensive laptops that have a 5400 rpm HDD.
"
"First of all, I got this for about Rs 19200 and I will be  reviewing as per that price.The body is plastic but not that shiny plastic HP usually provides that gets scratched easily.1. Display is Fine. Not too good or bad.2. Keyboard is fine again. No backlit keyboard as expected for the price.3. Mouse pad is a bit slow but you can always increase the sensitivity.4. Gesture support is there.5. Battery Life is good. I charged the laptop to 100 and watched Netflix offline for 2 hours on full brightness and earphones. The battery then dropped to 85. SO YOU CAN EXPECT GOOD BACKUP6. GAMING: I played basic games like GTA Vice City and it ran fine as expected.7. SSD: OMG! This makes a huge difference. The PC boots in about 5 seconds. Even though the storage is only 256GB but it is worth it as it makes the laptop faster that my other HP with i5 8th gen processor8. You get 2 USB 2.0, 1 USB 3.0, 1 Ethernet, 1 HDMI, 1 headphone jack, 1 SD card reader as ports.9. Speakers are good. Not too loud nor too tiny.10. I think it has a small fan. I did not face any heating issues.11. Webcam is there of OK qualityOverall a very good buy under 20K. I would definitely recommend this product
"
"Got this for 19k on prime day deal. Good laptop for school students. 256gb ssd, reasonable processor 4417U which is power efficient. RAM is 4gb, I will upgrade later. Resolution is only 720p, but can't complain at this price.Overall highly recommed this. Looks and feels like premium laptop.Windows 10 is great. This laptop does not come with latest 1903 build. Easily updatable via windows update.First thing you do after setuo, uninstall mccafe software. No need for it, use windows defender, built in antivirus software.Also uninstall other crapware like dropbox, hp apps etc.
"
"Just received the laptop. Everything is  expected. Display so smooth and sharp. Loving it. Windows and office both got activated. Thin & really light. Booting is slow actually don't know why. Will write a review again in couple of days. Go for it!
"
" I had great hopes from this laptop. And I really needed it to work as expected, as a laptop is crucial for my business. But it stopped working within 4 days of receiving and now I'm stuck, for god knows how long.I hope it gets more negative ratings to show everyone what it truly is....garbage.Bottomline: Avoid buying cheap laptops from Amazon.You get what you pay for!
"
"Pros:- This is a good entry level laptop with super compact build quality- Very light laptop and easy to carry- The keypad is great, comes with 1-month subscription of McAfee and also comes with Office 2019 School edition- Sound quality, picture quality are all top class. Very good for home usage and light office work- Good options on the touchpadCons:- No touch screen- No backlit keyboard- No extendable memory slot to raise to 16 GB RAM
"
"All these seems a good customized specifications for fast performance because of 256GB SSD PCIe NVMe SSD. The NVMe SSD is even faster and advanced than normal SSD. So understand the difference. So this HDD is more fast in SSD's.But as per the description,  there is no DVD Drive. Please beware of that.Pros:1.Thin2.Handy and weight less.3.Full HD.4.Sound is good.5.Fast/Prompt Responsive.6.PCIe NVMe SSDCons:1.No Keyboard Back light.2.No DVD Writer.3.Microsoft Product activation not working properly for few devices.4.When using high volumes, speakers getting cracking sound.5. No VGA slot. (Very few people still use, not much issue).6. No USB C-Port.7. No USB 3.1Let's see how it work's moving ahead.Overall Best Buy for working professionals with decent performance because of 256GB SSD PCIe NVMe SSD.
"
"Faster than the high end laptops. it is because of SSD technology used.Tried watching 1080p videos from youtube. no lag in anywhere.sound quality is good in headphones. speakers are ok for normal use.boot time is at its best. less than 10 seconds.battery lasts more than expected. around 4-5 hours for moderate use.no cd drive is there. that is not required nowadays. so not an issue.windows 10 home and student is installed and activated for lifetime.no heating spotted during the operation. this is because of SSD i think.webcam is good for normal chats. not a HD one. but still good.display is not HD. but still good for watching movies.never tried playing any games.weight is less compared to other laptops in this range.one downside is the office version is trial only. need to pay around 8k for lifetime license.PS:please uninstall the mcafee and other junk softwares first on first boot itself. windows defender is good enough to protect the pc.Price is oscillating in amazon. track via eoffersindia to get the price drop alert and then buy.
"
"Bought this as my back to college laptop and it didn't disappoint. My all friends are considering this I just bought another 1tb ssd with this and whole set up just took off.Played whole assassin's Creed black flag a little lag but certainly playable.Also all of my engineering softwares run smoothly never experienced any lag(except sucky WiFi at my college)Overall best laptop for 20k and buy another HDD you've got production power house in budget.
"
"It was delivered as oer promised date and product was in good condition. I am hoping HP is good brand and recepient will make best use of same
"
"Great laptop for the price. Got it at19.5k. Battery life is decent about 6-7 hours, feel and finish is pretty decent. Great SSD which makes it real fast, boot-up time is 12-15 seconds.Negatives- Keyboard is just okay and HD resolution, but at this price, these cons are well acceptable.
"
"Probably the first one to review the 4GB RAM, 256GB SSD model.Got this on Independence day sales for 30,390 with 10% instant discount on SBI card. For people wondering about the performance, it has 256Gb SSD which makes the performance and boot up faster than the 1Tb HDD model. It's perfect for home use and student use, not for gamers or photoshop.My advice go for it, if you belong to the above usage categories as this is the best config available at this price point. SSD over 8GB RAM and 1TB HDD anytime, because you can always add extra RAM and have a portable HDD if needed.
"
"The product is not good. Start lagging from the very first day. It Look beautiful but it doesn't work beautiful. Yeh toh tatti hai. And you can't even return it🤷‍♀🤷‍♀🤷‍♀
"
"After using a month I can't stop myself  from writing a review. Due to SSD the laptop become a rocket. Wow !!Please note that it's not a gaming laptop. But best for the normal official work,web browsing, simple editing etc.
"
"Screen is really good... Display is just awesome... Laptop is sleek and lightweight... However the battery backup is pathetic... At the best 3-4 hours maximum... Comes with a 30 day trial McAfee anti-virus free... So be careful if you are installing any other anti virus software... Ensure you de-install the McAfee anti virus completely before you install any other ant virus software... Else the system crashes frequently... Had a similar problem and then had to restore factory settings... Overall a good laptop but needs a better battery backup
"
"Good product for basic usage. Feels lightweight but performance is sturdy. Battery is good. Genuine windows 10 is a bonus at this price point. 😊
"
"Go for ssd laptops.very high performance speed. Win10 loads in 5-10 second with Kaspersky internet security. I3 and i5 are over priced. You won't notice any delay with processing speed. It's at par with i3 processor. Also as it's sdd weight is very light. Go for it.
"
"Everything's good performance,sound,display not for gaming though super comfortable slim and light
"
"The laptop has a hardware problem surrounding the CPU usage. From the day I have bought it, I am seeing a 100% CPU usage for Skype and Windows Explorer running in my laptop. I think this is a very minimum that one would expect to run smoothly, but the laptop gets heated up and it doesn't respond to any clicks. From next day onwards laptop is started auto-repairing, auto-fixing by itself. Cannot open the laptop till today. Horrible experience after buying this.
"
"Amazing product and has a stylist look to it. Photography is my hobby and I bought this to meet my needs of sharpening picture on Adobe Photoshop. But ever since I start editing my pics on Photoshop the systems works surprisingly slow for a i5 with 8 GB. Expected better performance.
"
"Good specification from world brand HP, licenced Windows 10. Suitable for colleges students. cost effective, only problem is MS Office trial version for 30 days
"
"Excellent Purchase ...Reliable Brand ..Smooth OS.. Got it for 21k ....Looks like a Good Deal 🤗
"
"Battery life last 2 or 3 hours max as normal uses,  screen quality little bit lighter,  weight is fine as per the mention but I got only laptop and charger nothing....very simple, no bag etc. And also packaged was worst and simplicity just cover up by cartoon .....but I'm happy doing offer I got this for Rs.19.999 in range this stuff is good but if the is higher than 20k then don't go for this stuff.

"Hello readers, reviewing this laptop after 5 days limited usage. hope you find my review helpful to make decision..1. Very light weight, as good as mac...!!2. Incredebly fast... it having SSD... Windows 10 boots in less than 5 sec..!!3. Keyboard quality also good, Sound quality also very good with stereo effect.4. Looks premium product.. Build quality is very good.5. It is a new generation's lappy, so having inbuilt battery, so no user serviciable part inside..6. Pentium Gold Processor which is as good as Core i3 + 4 GB RAM + 256 GB SSD + Windows 10 Licence Copy... Bang for the bucks...!!!A decent laptop for your basic work like ms office, internet surfing, youtube, etc. Please note the config is made for normal office use so dont except to autocad, minitab to run on this. Also it is not made for gaming like nfs the run and all.If you are clear about your use and exceptions, this laptop is CHota Packet Bada Dhamaka...I purchased this in only 20K in Great indian Sale. and what you are getting in this prise?? Brand like HP along with SSD. Compared to traditional SATA HDD it makes huge diffanance. So fast for working, premium feel, Lightweight like Mac.. Must buy... If you are like to dump all the gigs of movies into your laptop, you can purchase external usb drive for that purpose. For our daily usage SSD making huge diffarance than HDD.  also it having 2 USB 3.0 ports making faster file transfer within compatable devices.Please note this dosent have DVD-RW Drive, Battery also non-removable, Laptop Bag also not provided.I am very happy with my purchase.. Thanks amazon.in for making my day....!!
"
"Boots up in max 5 seconds due to ssd.Very nice windows 10.4gb ram enough..Rest is fine..Good for students...I do programming and daily stuff like reading pdf and watching videos.It works like a charm.Bought it in 20k.Really good value for money product.Completely satisfied!
"
"1. It takes only 4-5 sec to on the laptop and ready to work for.2. External hardware is made of very lower quality plastic.3. Screen Color is ok, don't expect much more in this price.4. very light weight.5. Battery backup is quite nice.6. For MS office, i will recommend to buy a genuine office from snapdeal.com for ₹ 700-900 range.7. Battery is not removable like any smartphone today. For replacement of battery, you have to visit hp service center.
"
"Very good works as expected. I never expected Windows would be this good. I am also using a Macbook Pro and it seems both are at par in terms of speed. The resolution is just okay and works for me as i don't need high resolution screen. I am using it just for my personal use and no high processing application.
"
"Light for carry like a Book/copyDisplay have the minimum colour quality,Light speaker sound,
"
"To start with the price point ...and considering this is <20K, this is one of the smoothest operating laptop I have used in this range. The SSD disk works wonders. Battery backup is pretty good and for house hold requirements and even beyond, this works perfect. The overall build is good and kind of mat finish makes it even better and scratch resistant.Considering 14"" screen, the resolution is OK, sound quality is pretty good. Very good value for money.
"
"Positive reviews of this product are just making you fool. This product is useless. For sure you will regret if you buy this product.
"
"Black dotted line on screen within 15 days use .Worst product
"
"the laptop is really good and the delivery was also fast but i did not receive an invoice for my product
"
"Hello, I have bought this laptop during Amazon sale by exchanging my old dell i3 laptop which is the best deal. I must say boot up and shut down is super fast due to SSD. My usage is very minimal such as web browsing, watching movies, using MS office etc. for which it's a perfect buy. I am also using external hard drive to fulfill my additional need for space. If I compare it with my old dell Vostro 3446 laptop then it's a great value for money.
"
"I ordered this laptop for 18k (with Bank Offer) during the Great Indian Festival Sale. The laptop was delivered the next day and the packaging was great, too. Following is my review after using it for 15 days.Performance:This is the only laptop that comes with an SSD at this price point, and trust me, it makes a huge difference in the responsiveness of the system and the boot up speed. Windows boots in 4-5 seconds, apps such as Microsoft Word, Chrome, etc. start instantly. The Pentium Dual Core comes with hyperthreading, which means 4 logical cores. It is a decent performer when it comes to Web Browsing, Word Processing, Video Playback, etc. The best part is that although it comes with 4GB of RAM out of the box, it can easily be upgraded to 8 or even 12GB, since one RAM slot is empty. It also has a slot for a 2.5 inch drive, so another SSD or HDD can be added if the 256GB doesn't suffice. Word of advice: The laptop does come with a ton of bloatware, so be sure to uninstall the needless games and software.Build Quality:It definitely feels like it's a more expensive laptop than it really is. Although the chassis is made out of plastic, it is very good quality. There's very little flex on the keyboard deck as well as the screen. The keyboard keys feel tactile with good travel and the trackpad offers accurate tracking with reliable gesture control.Media Consumption:The screen does go decently bright but the colours aren't as punchy as I'd like. The 14 inch display is a good size. Also the resolution is limited to 1366x768, but at this price, I guess you really can't complain. The laptop doesn't break a sweat even when playing 4K Videos, locally or YouTube, so you can always use an external display  with the peace of mind that the hardware can handle it. The speakers get loud and stay clear even at high volume. The bass is a little lacking, though.Battery Life:On light to medium usage, such as YouTube video playback, web browsing, word processing, etc I got around 6-7 hours of battery on a single charge. The laptop also comes with fast charging, so it can be charged from 0 to 100 in under 2 hours.Final thoughts:This laptop was meant as a replacement for an old desktop computer for my dad. We're both very happy with the purchase. If you're in need of a secondary PC or are looking for a computer to replace that old desktop your parents are using, this laptop should definitely be taken under consideration. Be sure to buy this laptop during a sale, since this particular configuration which is normally available for 25k, goes down to 20k. A bank offer only sweetens the deal further.
"
"Just received today. At first I wasn't impressed with the product as it is average in look because I was planning to go for natural silver colour but unfortunately by checking out price with ssd, I choosen to buy this one rather than wasting another 10-15k. Performance wise product is great. Battery life is also good. Screen resolution will is average. Overall value for money. No other product or brand offer same configuration at such an amazing price point. Got it in 18240.

"A value for money laptop with new pentium gold processor and SSD.

"This is a very good product by hp.Latest CPU,OS,SSD,DDR4 Makes this Device very fast.You can buy this Note Book for your Secondary  Work Device for Heavy User, Primary Device for Students,Normal Business persons..

"All the features of the Laptop are good except for brightness.Uninstall MCAfee to reduce CPU usage which usually shows 100%.The boot time is less than 10 seconds which I liked the most. This could be due to SSD and i3 processor.
"
"This laptop is very slow. It's been two months, I have been using this laptop. And it's slow. It had been slow since the day I got this delivered.
"
"Not at all a good one.  Poor speed. Keys are hard.  Not come with pre-installed MS Office, for which you have to spend extra.  Overall my old Dell was better than this one.  Wrongly exchanged hoping for a better performance.  THE REVIEWS ARE ALSO APPEARS TO BE FABRICATED.

"Wow. what a product for the price. I can't believe that it comes with an SSD for this price. It is really good. Defintely recommend someone to buy it.
"
"Product achieved my expectations and highly recommended at this price point
"
"Good product. Must go for it. Slim and sexy laptop. Easy to carry. Also the response is good. It takes 30-40s to boot which is not bad. Not for gaming.
"
"This laptop was priced around 20000 and a lot of purchase happened around this price margin and all the positive reviews above are made during that period.And as an advantage of those positive reviews and increased demand the Amazon has increased the price margin above 25k which is not at all worthy for this product. This product is best on 20k and average on 22k margin and above 23k it's not recommended so go for some other product.
"
"The MS office is not working asking for product key for activation.  Although the model comes with pre-loadedoffice 10. Pl  provide product key .outlook is not working with pop up message to activate.
"
"I had great hopes from this laptop. And I really needed it to work as expected, as a laptop is crucial for my business. But it stopped working within 4 days of receiving and now I'm stuck, for god knows how long.I hope it gets more negative ratings to show everyone what it truly is....garbage.Bottomline: Avoid buying cheap laptops from Amazon.You get what you pay for!i want for replace i look 4/1TB but amazon sent the item 4/256GB only you know very well today 256GB not kch nhi hager muhje 4/1Tb mita h to m uske islye aur paise dene k lye ready huamazon HP ki market m value khrb kr rha h.so ilsye dear sir apko kch krna pdega nhi to ak time esa aayega jab HP koi nhi lena kyuki m phle bhi HP tha mere perilsye mne HP ko liyabut amazon esa nhi chahata ilsye apko sochna pdega.

"I bought this laptop at 20k+10% SBI debit card discount....My varient is 4gb ram,256gb ssd. Boot time is just amazing.It boots in 3-5 sec...After using 1week I don't have any problems like hang and all that stuffs.Every thing is good except screen,you can't use it in sunlight...but at this price it is good choice otherwise everything is perfect...🙂
"
"Nice product. Worth purchase at this cost. Would have been better if MS Office (permanent version) could have been part of the OS.Battery life is also OK, Screen resolution is nice with light weight one can enjoy the working. Dont know how the gamming experience is but for normal office / study purpose i can recommend the product.Fully satisfied with the product.

"It is a good laptop. All features are good. Whatever is written in the specs stand upto the mark. I played Call of duty MW its a 6-7 gb game. It worked fine. 5-6 hours battery back up. Not overheating. 5 ghz wifi not available. Ssd makes booting faster less than 5 sec. Everything is perfect.

"Well, i had purchased the laptop on Sunday night, early prime day sale, it cost me around 18k after offers and formalities.The first thing i can say the delivery is Super awesome, recieved the device in 14 hours.Performence is incredible at such price.Disappointment comes on display, but for such price, it's ok!I had removed mcaffe antivirus as it was consuming lot of memory.Speakers are below average. But the laptop look is gorgeous.I recommend it for students, and for basic workers!!

"I bought it after checking that it has i5. My earlier i5 hp laptop was good when it came heavy computing tasks. I did a comparison of this one with old laptop by running simple excel aggregation functions. This one stood out in the test. So frankly I was happy initially.But then when I used it for operations that took hours to complete I saw that it froze frequently. The CPU hits 100% pretty fast. I guess the freezing is due to overheating. The exhaust ducts are placed in a such way that they get completely covered when flap is down. That could be reason.Otherwise it works fine.

"I got this laptop for about Rs. 16.2k - combining exchange and festival offers. The smart thing that HP did with the laptop is replacing the standard 1 TB HDD generally available at these price points with a 256 GB HDD. For most home purposes - light office work and streaming - this is actually the better choice. The SSD has given it better battery life, the laptop is pretty lightweight and suffices for all homely work. Combined with a pre-loaded Windows, this is a steal at this price.

"Screen quality

"It has met my expectations, in terms of speed, form factor, display quality. I am enjoying it.I have only one small issue - the power button is too small and one is not sure if it has been pressed properly to power on.  The Led indication light is on the side, and one has to bend sideways to check if it has been powered on.
"
"I bought this exchanging my Acer Aspire V5 intel i3 laptop since Pentium Gold processor is almost same, except for lesser L3 cache memory (3 MB to 2 MB).There is absolutely no heating or any other issues due to SSD. This fits my requirement of day to day browsing, reading, videos etc.  Very good laptop for this price.Good price for old laptop & card discount from ICICI due to Diwali sale.

"If you like to analyse for hours/days/weeks even, before buying a product, especially the technical stuff, then this review's helpful for you.To be honest, I was super scared to buy this. I know HP has a good reputation, but there was hardly any review regarding this product and not any detailed one. Plus I bought it during Diwali sale so the time was running. And the purchase was to be made in prepaid manner since Amazon doesn't allow COD on products costing this much, and there is no return but only replacement allowed on this laptop, so YIKES! Thankfully I did my homework for whole 2 days, learnt the basics of buying a laptop (type of ram I would prefer. what processor, battery strength, etc.) and searched around a lot and decided that this was the one I could get for greatest value at lowest price (Anyone else who is technologically disabled as I am, please refer to Amazon's laptop buying guide - that helped me a lot to understand what I want on my own and compare various models to narrow down on the one according to my priorities).Quality of laptop:Looks 9/10: I love the silver and textured look that this lappy gives off. The one star I deducted was because I have been told that the keyboard has been an issue for few customers because the letters are printed in dark gray. so there is not much of contrast. This wasn't an issue with me, coz I am already a fast typist and can type without continuously searching on keyboard. Please look at the images of the keyboard I have attached with this review and judge for yourself.Is it a fast laptop?: 9/10 Damn yes! Obviously during the initial setup it took quite a few minutes. After doing that, this lappy is super fast. I am a research scholar. I don't indulge in gaming right now. But I almost always have like 20-30 tabs open simultaneously for weeks or months together. So far, this lappy with its 8 gb ram seems to function efficiently even though I've got 10 tabs open right now. I deducted 1 star because I want to see if this will behave the same way after heavy usage. I will update this again after a few months of usage and change the rating accordingly.How's the battery?: 8/10 It came with a 39% charged one. I charged it to 100% and plugged it out. I have been watching videos online and downloading and browsing study stuff for the past 1 hour and it only reduced to 85% and that is doable for me. Happy with this one, coz no particular specification is mentioned related to battery usage in the specifications except for 3-cell battery mention (I asked my tech friend about this and he had said it should work upto 6 hours with regular browsing). I deducted 2 stars because of my own jealousy, coz another laptop by HP is available in the touchscreen series at same price with claim of 7 hours battery life in average and upto 13 at max. I gave that up for this, because my friend has had a touchscreen one, and the reflective surface is simply horrifying - too reflective, super sensitive, not at all visible from side angles/if you are standing at a peripheral position. Anyway, I hope this one does me prouder. 2 stars deducted also because laptops with 7-8 hours battery life are available at the same price. I will update it again after I check when the battery drains completely after heavy usage.The screen: 9.5/10! The only reason I was hesitant about was because I did not want a reflective surface screen - those are absolute headaches, my eyes hurt plus I get super scared looking at my own reflection after watching a horror movie (ha!). Anyway, this product surprised me with exactly what I wanted - a MATTE screen!! Not a screen skin/guard but the screen itself! In the specifications it was mentioned that a standard LED backlit screen's available, so I thought I was settling. But this was such a pleasant surprise. The matte screen does not reflect, the glare's low even if I increase the brightness plus really contributes to the laptop's aesthetics. Then why didn't I rate this 10/10? Because I am greedy and I really like if when the LCD covers the whole of screen. I am not really fond of the black body around a screen. Basically I like the TV look on a laptop (if that makes sense), a higher screen to body ratio. But at this price? Steal this!Sound: 8/10 The sound is sooooooo much better than I expected. Clear and loud too. I deducted 2 stars, coz well, like I said I am a greedy girl and the louder it is, the better!Ease of navigating Windows 10: 10/10 My tech friend had advised me not to go for Windows 10 coz it lags/hangs. I am super glad that I chose not to listen to him. I have been using Windows 7 professional up to now. So I was a little nervous to switch. But the transition is super smooth. Everything is easier to find and access.MS Office 2019 version: 9/10 I am a PhD scholar. So you can imagine the value of this for me. I wasn't willing to compromise on this version. But when I tried to activate, it was showing that only Office 365 version can be activated on this, nothing about the 2019 version. So I had a mini heart attack. After 5 mins of trying to use Office 365 version though, automatically a notification came up that prompted me to update the current version to Office Home and Student 2019 version (Phew!).I love the Microsoft Search feature they are showing off right now though. I deducted 1 star because I have received this lappy a week ago. I wanna use this for a longer period of time and update in case any issue comes up with this.Why buy this online instead of offline? At the same price, I was getting an offer to buy HP laptop with same specifications except for 4 gb ram and free goodies like headphones, bags, usb lights, pendrives, etc. But those over a 8 gb ram at the same price? Are you kidding me? This is a no brainer. You can buy the goodies yourself for under 1200 INR. But having a new ram of 4 gb difference plus the installation charges that would be charged to change/modify the old processor would amount at least up to 4k. Now it's a matter of priorities. Goodies vs better processor aka speed.I HAD ONE ISSUE WITH MY LAPTOP MODEL THOUGH:On the keyboard. above 2 number button ""@"" icon was made, but whenever I tried to press it, inverted comma/"" appeared and ""@"" appeared when I pressed "" button. I thought this was a malfunction in the hardware? Maybe the icons got misplaced? I know it is a small matter. But oh well, my mind's been wired to the traditional keyboard style and I wasn't looking to experiment with it. After an hour though, it became okay (o.O ??) Like it was supposed to in the first place. This is strange and sounds weird. Anyway, why I mentioned this here is if this happens to you, give it an hour or so and keep using your laptop normally. If it still doesn't get resolved like mine did (by magic?), then do contact the customer support of Amazon or ask for a replacement if it irks you enough.Thanks for reading my lengthy review!
